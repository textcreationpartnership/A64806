            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Memorandum;</hi> A Speech made in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church in <hi>Warwick,</hi> the ſecond day of <hi>September,</hi> 1660. for the ſatisfaction of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation there aſſembled, upon my beginning to Read the Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer</hi> again publickly in the Church, after ſixteen years diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved, Before we begin Prayers, let me preadviſe you of ſome things: Sudden Changes in the Church or State have often been attended with ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and events: Many have been the ſad changes and wofull alterations, of which we of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have had miſerable experience for theſe eighteen years last paſt. Amongſt which, after the most execrable murther of the late Kings Majeſty of bleſſed memory, and with him the abolition and extirpation of Kingly Government to the utter undoing of the whole Nation, both Church and State (as much as in them lay) and the irrecoverable and irreparable ruine of them
<pb facs="tcp:173117:4"/>both: (I ſay) after ſuch a <hi>nefandum ſcelus,</hi> a wickedneſſe not to be named amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. There have befallen two other things which do much reflect upon the Church, which are: <hi>1.</hi> The extirpation of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and <hi>2.</hi> The expulſion of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or form of (<hi>Common-Prayer</hi> or) Gods publick Worſhip and Service, and of divine Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> For the firſt: <hi>viz. Epiſcopaay:</hi> It is I think ſufficiently proved, and may therefore be eaſily granted, that there is ground enough in the Gospel and the practice of the Primitive and ſucceeding Ages, for the continuance of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, Paternal, Primitive Epiſcopacy</hi> in the Church to the end of the World, ſo long as the Lord Jeſus is the chief Biſhop of our ſouls, <hi>1 Pet. 2.25. See King Charles</hi> Anſwer to <hi>Alex. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,</hi> and to our Engliſh Divines at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Weight.</hi> See alſo Biſh. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſh. <hi>Hall.</hi> Yet this Government muſt down, Root and Branch without either conviction, or tryal, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Primitive practice, and all this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie the ambition and avarice of ſome men, who did eagerly deſire and greedily gape after the Biſhops Authority and Estates. Which Government thus overthrown, we have been left without any Government in the Church ever ſince <hi>Septemb. 1. 1642.</hi> (juſt eighteen yeares compleat this day) to the great distraction and confuſion both of this Church and Nation. But I ſhall ſay no more of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> at this time (of which much might be ſaid) but I leave it
<pb facs="tcp:173117:5"/>to the wiſdome of the King and Parliament to ſettle ſuch a Government, as ſhall be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the Churches welfare, <hi>faxit Deus,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy being thus rooted out: yet the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of theſe men is not ended.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The next thing which muſt be expulſed and quite excluded in the Church, is the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or form of Gods publick worſhip, divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Adminiſtrations, commonly called the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that Set-forms of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have good authority from the Word of God. <hi>1.</hi> God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſet-form of bleſſing the people, <hi>Num. 6.23. 2.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> appointed ſet-pſalmes for ſeveral occaſions, as the Titles of them do ſhew, <hi>Pſalm 92.3.</hi> And <hi>Joel</hi> a ſet-form of prayers for a ſolemn Faſt, <hi>Joel 2.17. 4.</hi> Yea, and Christ himſelf, that commands us to pray after ſuch a manner, and preſcribes us a Rule of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Mat. 6.9.</hi> even he commands us to uſe the ſet-forms of words by him preſcribed, <hi>Luke 11.2.</hi> Thus you have divine Authority enough for a ſet-form of Prayer: yet add <hi>5.</hi> Of all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, premeditated prayers are the beſt, <hi>Eccl. 5.1.</hi> and of ſuch, thoſe allowed by publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are to be preferred before thoſe which are to be uttered by any private Spirit. <hi>6.</hi> Beſides all the Churches in the Chriſtian World, in the firſt and beſt times had their ſet-forms of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: many of which are extant in the writings of the Fathers. <hi>7.</hi> And yet more, Let our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy be compared with the Liturgies of other
<pb facs="tcp:173117:5"/>Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> the French, Dutch, Daniſh, Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick, or any of the Lutheran or Calvinian Churches; or with any of thoſe of the Eaſtern Churches now extant: The Armenian, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan, the Syrian, Egyptick, the Greek Aeuchology: that of <hi>Cyril,</hi> or St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> commonly called <hi>Officium Ambroſianum</hi> or any other antient or latter: yet ours will appear to be the moſt exact and compleat of any of them, and comprehenſive of any thing that is excellent in any of them. <hi>8.</hi> Laſtly, Our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy it is confeſſed, was penned and allowed by learned Doctors and glorious Martyrs, who ſealed the truth of the Reformed Religion with their Bloods, So than it was the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion expreſſed in the Articles ſet forth by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>An. Dom. 1552.</hi> Collected from, and ſuitable to the holy Scriptures, for which they dyed, rather then for the Liturgy of their own compoſing: which is a great miſtake of many, both which Articles and Liturgy (with ſome alterations and additions) were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain revived and ratified by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the beginning of her Reign <hi>(viz. an. 1. Eliz. c. 2.)</hi> and the ſame Articles and Liturgy have been continued by K. <hi>James,</hi> and K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, all of bleſſed memory, and ſo they remain at this day. Yet <hi>quaedam in pulchro corpore ſunt deſideranda &amp; emendanda,</hi> the faireſt face may have ſome blemiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I am ſure there have been many wiſe, judicious and very learned men, who have earnestly and long deſired that
<pb facs="tcp:173117:6"/>ſome few things both in Hierarchy and frame of Church-Government by Epiſcopacy, as alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Lyturgy or Form of Gods publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might (without noiſe or tumult) have been regulated and altered for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inconveniencies which might enſue.</p>
            <p>But our late Reformers (as they pretended, and called themſelves) were of another ſtrain, nothing would ſerve, but the ruine of the one, and the utter expulſion of the other: For my part, <hi>1.</hi> I ſhould think him an evil Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, who to cure a Mole, a Freckle, a Wart, or ſmall Wen in a fair face, doth kill the perſon to effect it. <hi>2.</hi> And him to be as bad a Builder or Workman, who to mend a Quarry of glaſs in a Window, or to put on a Tyle upon the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> plucks down the whole houſe to do it; and thus did our late Deformers deal by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and the Tyturgy. But,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As by the Extirpation of Epiſcopacy was uſhered in, and attended, proceeded, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded no better, then with a moſt terrible, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and bloody civil War, to the amazement of wiſe men, the conſternation of the beſt men, and the aſtonistment of all men.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> So the Expulſion of the Lyturgy was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded with the death of the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (nothing elſe would ſerve) and attended with expunging the clauſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Majeſties Perſon, out of the Commiſſion of their General in the Army: Theſe were the bad Neighbours of two things,
<pb facs="tcp:173117:6"/>which were abſolutely bad enough in themſelves. And as the ruine of Epiſcopacy did ſerve to enrich a company of greedy Cormorants, who Oſtrich-like, could devour any thing: Or like that fooliſh Aeagle in the Fable, would needs have a Morſel, a Bit or Gobbet from the Altar, though therewith ſhe ſet fire on her own neſt, and ruined her ſelf. So the Expulſion of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy opened a wide gap to all the whimſical fancies, fanatiek Opinions, Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies that have ſo abounded, and ſo much infeſted the Church of God ever ſince: whilſt every man was left to his own abilities, inventions and expreſſions; and every man that could but talk a little, and make uſe of any good language, was preſently cryed up for a Gifted Brother, and compleatly fitted for the Miniſtry, without any more ado.</p>
            <p>And hence, no doubt, hath been abundance of Non-ſenſe (if not worſe) uttered by men of weak abilities, parts and gifts, in celebrating the Myſteries of God. And hence have ſprung thoſe ſwarms of Sectaries that have ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed us. Yet as the best vertues are attended with a vice on each hand, as Liberality with Avarice and Prodigality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the beſt men have enemies, and the beſt buſineſs ſhall be ſure of ſome Opponents: So the Liturgy, or form of Gods publick worſhip, or the Book of Common-Prayer hath two great enemies. <hi>1.</hi> Thoſe that ſet it too high, and deify it.

Theſe people do by the Book of the Common-Prayer, as the Children of Iſrael did by the braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, (reſerved and kept as a monument of Gods mercy to their Anceſtors) was ſo doted upon, as that they gave divine honour to it: Then did that good King <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Kin. 18.4.</hi> break it in pieces, that God might no longer be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby. Take heed, beloved, of perverting lawful and uſeful things to evil ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. This ſort of people do commit a three-fold Injury; <hi>viz.</hi> Againſt, <hi>1.</hi> The Book. <hi>2.</hi> The Compoſers.

<pb facs="tcp:173117:7"/>of God in the holy Scriptures which were ſpoken and written by divine inſpiration. Now is not this to for ſake the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hew us out broken Ciſterns that can hold no water. Others there be, who do vilifie, and would exclude utterly all forms of prayer; and indeed all things elſe, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to order and decency, unity and peace in the Church, ſo much are theſe men taken with their own fancies and inventions: All forms of prayer with them are carnal, formal papal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do ſtint the ſpirit, which laſt is (yet) no more done by this, then by ſinging of ſet Pſalms, which they themſelves do practiſe, and make uſe of in their own Aſſemblies. Sure if theſe men be in the right, and that no forms of Prayers are to be regarded: Then to what purpoſe are all thoſe pious helps to devotion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were compoſed and publiſhed for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good by ſo many worthy men who were truly learned and godly, religious and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſeveral generations. But theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors are abundantly anſwered by ſo many eminent men, and excellent pens, that I need ſay no more. To conclude therefore, Beloved, be ye ſure to avoid both theſe extreams, for they are both very dangerous. If you rely upon the Liturgy as alone all-ſufficient to ſalvation, and thereupon neglect or contemn the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Word of God, you are loſt for ever; for the Lyturgy was authorized, repealed and reviv'd again only by Act of Parliament, which
<pb facs="tcp:173117:8"/>may repeal it again: It is not ſo with the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>On the oeher fide; If men will vilifie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, deſpiſe, and ſpeak evil of the things they know not, <hi>Jude 10.</hi> and are not willing to underſtand aright, as multitudes do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do tacitly condemn thoſe Worthies, Martyrs, and others, who were our firſt Reformers, and wiſe Compilers of our publick Lyturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſuch do but diſcover their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and folly, and do expoſe themſelves to the contempt of underſtanding, wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, of deeply learned and truly religious men. Be ſure that you run upon neither of theſe rocks, to the ſplitting of your veſſel, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hazards, or loſs of all your precious fraight, your immortal ſouls eſpecially; but have an eye to the Word of God, as <hi>2 Pet. 1.19.</hi> as to the Pole ſtar of perfection, and ſteer the card and compaſs of your opinions, affections and converſations, according to that infallible guide and unchangable diroction; ſo ſhall you be ſure to arrive at laſt in the haven of reſt, and attain to the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls, <hi>1 Pet. 1.9.</hi>

            <p>Thus much I have thought good to pread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and pre-admoniſh you of, before I was willing to enter upon the uſe of the Lyturgy, or form of Publick and Common Prayers after ſo long a diſcontinuance, and the rather, becauſe (as I am credibly informed) even this form is like to appear before long with ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:173117:8"/>which I was willing to have waited for: I having always ſhunned (to the beſt of my underſtanding) ſuch things as render a man like a Turning-ſtyle, to be whirled about by the next Paſſenger, ſuch prepoſterous haſt and ſudden changes have (I am ſure) loſt many (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſteemed) wiſe men, very much in their reputation; But the impetuouſneſs of peoples ſpirits will never give a man leave to make his own choice, norto make uſe of his diſcretion in a convenient deliberation about things of this Conſequence; howſoever, the thing that I have ſpoken, I have done (I am ſure) out of a true reverential care of the honour of God, and of his holy Word. The faithful diſcharge of my own conſcience, who (now being aged) am going apace to my great account; And out of the tender reſpect I have of your ſouls, that you may learn to ſet a right eſtimate of things as they be, and may neither deifie things humane, nor vilifie things divine, but to weigh all things in the ſcales of the Sanctuary, and to value them accordingly: and ſo the things now ſpoken may ſerve as a common gage to direct you in the uſe of all, or any Lyturgy, or Form of Prayer whatſoever; that you may avoid the extreams on each hand, which men are apt to fall upon or ruſh into: that you may not turn in any thing from the right way of the word of God, nor to any ſide; whether of your own inventions, or others corruptions, but that you may depart from all evil, and be upright in all things
<pb facs="tcp:173117:9"/>which God hath commanded you: and that you may punctually obſerve that advice of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. <hi>4.27.</hi> which is of ſo great concernment in all caſes concerning Chriſtians; <hi>Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left, but remove thy foot from evil;</hi> which the good Lord give us Grace and ſtrength to do.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Germany,</hi> once ſo ſound in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is it not brought to Miſery and Deſolation, almoſt, upon the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>England,</hi> once the Glory of the Iſlands in the Earth for <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp;c. what a Labyrinth and Confuſion of Troubles, Errours and evil Opinions do overflow Her, and do threaten the like Ruine and Deſolation to us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church in this Conflict had need to be ſtrong, and, 1. Of a <hi>good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> and not to dread, nor be diſmayed. 1. <hi>As David</hi> inſtructed <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 22.13. 2. As <hi>Moſes,</hi> yea, and God himſelf inſtructed <hi>Joſhua</hi> formerly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.7, 8. <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.6, 7, 9. Great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements muſt have great ſtrength, and courage to bring them to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</p>
            <p>We are apt to be diſmaid, dicou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and terrified at difficulties, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173117:21"/>had need therefore to rouze up our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the more, as thoſe Inſtructions both Affirmative and Negative to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and to <hi>Solomon</hi> do import, <hi>viz. To be ſtrong, and not to fear,</hi> or be diſmayed. 2. Yet this ſtrength and courage muſt be in the Lord, and in the power of his Might. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil,</hi> 4.1.3 <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>whereby,</hi> 1. <hi>We lay hold on Chriſt, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his victory to us. He hath overcome the world,</hi> John 16.33. <hi>And given us victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57. And, 2. Get ſtrength from Him to go on in this ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare, till we have fully overcome all Satans Temptations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>The God of Peace ſhall bruiſe,</hi> or tread down, <hi>Satan under your feet,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul. Even the Devil whom you are to reſist ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. <hi>Ap.</hi> And thus by Faith you ſhall be Conquerors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus Chriſt in whom we believe, is the principal Agent or Efficient.</p>
            <p>And, 2. Faith the inſtrumental cauſe of this victory. For thoſe Saints and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173117:21"/>Martys of old overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, <hi>[i.e.]</hi> by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof; not by any worldly power or ſtrength, and by the word of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, <hi>[i.e.]</hi> by bearing witneſs to the Truth, which is called <hi>The Teſtimony of Jeſus, Rev.</hi> 12.10, 11, 17. becauſe <hi>Christ</hi> was the Object of their Confeſſion, Conſtancy and Martyrdome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus whileſt others, <hi>Goliah</hi> like, ſtrengthen themſelves in the Arm of fleſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of the Godly is in the Lord, and in the power of his Might; as <hi>Davids</hi> was, in that great encounter with the Gyant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.4, 5, 6, 7, 42, 45. Although with a Gyant of nine foot in height, and ſo armed, yet <hi>David</hi> the Youth remained the Conquerour over this mighty Monſter: ſo do the Saints over Satan by this aſſiſtance: and the Church at the beſt ſtate had need of ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. She hath need of compleat ſpiritual Armour, Armour of <hi>Proof</hi> that will not fail, nor deceive Her: ſuch is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour preſcribed in the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 14. to 19. Which alſo is,</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Defenſive;</hi> viz. 1. A <hi>Girdle.</hi> 2. A <hi>Breaſt-plate.</hi> 3. <hi>Shooes.</hi> 4. <hi>Shield.</hi> And, 5. An <hi>Helmet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Offenſive;</hi> viz. 1. <hi>A Sword.</hi> 2. <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication</hi> and <hi>Prayer:</hi> both which may be ſtyled both offenſive and defenſive alſo. For with the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> we do not only, 1. Wound our enemy: But, 2. Defend our ſelves alſo againſt the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Wiles, and violent Aſſaluts of our ſpiritual Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>☞ 1. With this <hi>Sword,</hi> the word of God our Saviour wounded the Devil, and cut to pieces the Snares, as well as repelled the violence of his various Temptations, <hi>Mat,</hi> 4.1. to 12. 2. And with this, The manifold Errours, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and evil Opinions of all Ages have been refuted and ouerthrown. 3. And with this, the Reigning and Domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſgreſſions of many a ſinner have been beaten down and ſlaughtered: and as it hath been a ſharp edged ſword, to cut down ſuch things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So it hath been as effectual to protect and preſerve the ſervants of God from the danger of them all.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:173117:22"/>
            <p>☞ The like may be ſaid of Prayer: Both for; 1. The Deſtruction of the Enemies of the Church, temporal or ſpiritual. 2. And for the procuring of Peace and Safety to the Church in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Exigents in all <hi>Ages.</hi> 3. And all this ſtrength, courage and compleat <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> muſt be rouzed up, and put on, that ſhe may be able to <hi>ſtand:</hi> 4. To <hi>withſtand:</hi> and, 5. <hi>Reſist</hi> the <hi>Craftineſs, Wiles</hi> and <hi>Deceits.</hi> 6. <hi>Mighty Aſſaults,</hi> and alſo the Violence, Rage and Fury. 7. Of ſo powerful an <hi>Enemy</hi> as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is. 8.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Tribulation</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal all in the day of this Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Temptation,</hi> when Satan is let looſe to tempt, and try the moſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Perſecution</hi> by <hi>Antichriſt, Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> in ſeveral ages; who have been inſtigated by Satan; 1. To make <hi>Havock</hi> of the Church as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.1, 2. Yea, 2. To <hi>Infect, Afflict,</hi> and

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173117:34"/>and perſecuting <hi>Hereticks.</hi> As it befel, 1. <hi>Job,</hi> who might well take up <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverb, and ſay as He, <hi>All the days of the afflicted are evil,</hi> Prov. 15.15. But eſpecially <hi>then</hi> when Satan was let looſe upon him to exerciſe him as he did, both outwardly; 1. <hi>In his Goods, Children</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> And, 2. Inwardly, <hi>in his Soul.</hi> 2. The Apoſtles, when their Maſter the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was taken and crucified, and themſelves left to be win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed by Satan, and perſecuted by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. 3. The <hi>Church of God,</hi> whoſe lot is Affliction: <hi>But her days are at the worſt, when ſhe is preſſed beyond meaſure,</hi> as 2 Cor. 1.8. by ſuch enemies as are above named, <hi>Antichriſtians, Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in ſuch times as theſe Satan is moſt active to do us harm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What he doth in the Day of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Tribulation, Sickneſs, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the diligent Viſitors of Sick-beds and dying perſons ſpeak their woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And what work he makes in the <hi>Day</hi> of Temptation when he is let looſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173117:34"/>as before, let doutful and deſpairful Souls ſpeak: for then his wiles, ſnares and depths are evident, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many fearful ſouls to revolt in the times of perſecution.</p>
            <p>☞ 10. Laſtly, It doth behove the Church to be thus prepared and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe may be able to <hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>withſtand,</hi> as it is four times urged in three verſes, <hi>viz. Ver.</hi> 11, 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>(i. e.) To ſtand;</hi> 1. Couragiouſly and valiantly in the Onſet and Entrace. 2. Unanimouſly and vigilantly, with the reſt of the Chriſtian Army, our Fellow-Soldiers; whether we be, 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers: Or, 2. Commanders and Leaders, being deſigned to ſuch and ſuch a place and employment either in the Church or State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Regularly and conſtantly in our Rank and Order, in our Condition and Station, keeping our ground, <hi>The ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Strenuouſly, with our utmoſt ſtrength in the Combate and Conflict, till all is done, the War ended.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:173117:35"/>all is done, the <hi>Enemy overcome,</hi> and the War is ended for ever.</p>
            <p>And thus it behooves the <hi>Church to ſtand,</hi> 1. <hi>Valiantly.</hi> 2. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> 3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly</hi> and <hi>conſtantly.</hi> 4. <hi>Strenuouſly,</hi> that ſhe may ſtand. 5. <hi>Victoriouſly in the end:</hi> and why ſo? But,</p>
            <p n="10">10. Becauſe if we ſtand not, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. Fail in our Courage, which betrayes our ſelves: Or, 2.

The <hi>Day</hi> is loſt, our <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> is gone, and vaniſht as a vapour: we are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and ſhall never ſtand victoriouſly; For nothing can be more prejudicial to an Army, then for men engaged therein to fail in theſe things: For if they, 1.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173117:35"/>ſure, They ſhall looſe the day, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, captivated, and quite undone.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Puſillanimity</hi> and <hi>Irreſolution.</hi> 2. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> and <hi>Differences.</hi> 3. <hi>Ataxy, Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>yielding back.</hi> 4.

            <p>Thus you have heard the point clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, proved both by Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all the parts and particulars of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Church</hi> when at the beſt: 2. Had need to be ſtrong in the Lord: 3. And compleatly armed: 4. To ſtand and withſtand: 5. The manifold Wiles: 6.

And yet that ſhe may ſtand and remain victorious and triumphant.</p>
            <p>The point thus proved, only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it remains: and as the proof of it, ſo alſo the Uſes muſt be ſuited to the ſeverel branches of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173117:36"/>Doctrine, and each particular Uſe ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to each Branch, may very well bear the weight of a fourfold improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Information, Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Reproof and Comfort.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> I.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. The like care did the <hi>Orthodox</hi> party take from time to time by <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Synodes,</hi> General, National and Provincial, to cruſh (if it might be) Errour in the bud, and prevent it of taking Root and growth.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Or hinder, and not admit of ſuch means whereby the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of a Church may be either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or cured, ſo that they may ſit at eaſe, and enjoy Immunity and Liberty without controul. And the firſt we ſhall take take to task for this fault, are the,</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:173117:38"/>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Romanists,</hi> or thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome (statu quo)</hi> in the ſtate it now ſtandeth, and that for three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Separation.</hi> 2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of, or obſtinacy in their Doctrine, or Tenents as now it is with them. 3. Their Independency and uncontrouable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs admitting no means of redreſs. The, 1. Began or entred them. The, 2. Enlarges them. And, the 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms them, and makes them obſtinate and incorrigible in Erronr.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They entred with <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches about divers things in which they manifeſted great Pride and Arrogancy: all tending to Schiſm and Diviſion, as the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their progreſs they made a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Separation from the Truth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particulars, which are evidently known, and ſtrenuouſly as well as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminouſly refuted by many Worthies: From all which Worthies they always ſeparated and departed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So that nevertheleſs they do
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173117:38"/>charge the crime of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> upon the <hi>Reformed Churches:</hi> yet the truth is, that theſe never ſeparated from them in what they were right, when the Apoſtle left them, (till forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) but only from their newly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Errors and Hereſies, which in porgreſs of time produced an <hi>incompata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of peace, and Communion with <hi>Rome.</hi> If they held to the <hi>orthodox faith,</hi> and right Doctrine of the Antients, they muſt proclaim no peace with <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ So as that the charge of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> fixed and charged by them upon us, is clearly and really found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Touching the uncertainty of their Doctrine and Tenets, and their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in the ſame; it is evident and clear, that when they once <hi>laid aſide</hi> the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and made the <hi>Popes Decrees,</hi> (or <hi>Decretals</hi>) of equal Authority with the Seriptures, the word of God. 1. Their Tenets are marvellouſly varied and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. 2. And they are ſtill obvious to more variations and changes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they be otherwiſe, whileſt they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:173117:39"/>do aſcribe a power to the <hi>Pope</hi> to add (at his pleaſure) to their unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which muſt as inviolably be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the commands of God, and therefore it is no wonder, that they do obſtinately perſiſt, and continue in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Touching their Independency, it is clearly manifeſt, that the Pope and the Clergy maintain themſelves to be free from, (yea, and above) the controule of any Authority, whether Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And therefore they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1, Reſiſt the pious, and grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the <hi>antient Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> and others of <hi>former times.</hi> 2. But ſince, they would never endure the tryal of an <hi>Oecumenick,</hi> (or general) Councel, though they have been often called upon to that <hi>end.</hi> 3. <hi>Much leſs of any inferior Synode,</hi> or <hi>other Councel,</hi> or any <hi>part of the Reformed Churches</hi> in all their advertiſements tending thereunto. So that by this <hi>means</hi> they prevent all <hi>ways imaginable</hi> by which they may be <hi>reformed of the manifold Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:173117:39"/>and <hi>Errors</hi> that are crept in amongſt them, which now can no more be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd than <hi>Gray hairs in the head,</hi> and the <hi>oyl in the hand of a man,</hi> Hoſ. 7.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of <hi>perſons</hi> jnſtly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for preventing a <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>recovery</hi> out of Errours, and Hereſies, and <hi>hindering the Church of helps</hi> in that caſe, are the <hi>antient Separatiſts of former times,</hi> which are guilty of, 1. <hi>Schiſm.</hi> 2. <hi>Hereſie.</hi> And herein to let paſs all thoſe <hi>abominable Hereſies</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, recorded by the <hi>Antients, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Auguſtinus, Ambroſ.</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look upon the two Sects of the faireſt of them, and that <hi>began with the greateſt pretence of piety,</hi> and <hi>zeal of Gods glory,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>Novatians.</hi> and, 2. <hi>Donatists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Novatians</hi> took their name of their <hi>Leaders,</hi> which were, 1. <hi>Novatus,</hi> A Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 250. 2. <hi>Novatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Presbyter of <hi>Rome,</hi> who became his Partner in <hi>errour</hi> at the <hi>ſame time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Novatus</hi> was a man of a <hi>Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit,</hi> and (aſſiſted by his <hi>Partner</hi>) he diſquied two (then) famous Churches, viz. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> by a rigid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173117:40"/>againſt ſuch as had fallen through infirmity in the times of perſecution, and had denied the <hi>Faith,</hi> (though after they <hi>deſired to be received to the Church</hi>) For he taught, 1. <hi>That there was no place of repentance left for ſuch,</hi> and therefore ſuch ſhould never be admitted again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellowſhip of the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they expreſs manifeſt ſigns of true Repentance. Hereupon they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Orthodoz party, who were otherwiſe perſwaded; And here began their <hi>Sehiſm.</hi> 2. They were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cathari,</hi> becauſe they boaſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be purer then others in life and manners: whereas our <hi>Purity</hi> only is, that <hi>our ſins are forgiven, and we are purged in the fountain of Chriſts blood, and ſanctified by his word and ſpirit,</hi> John 15.3. 1 John 1.7. 3. Yet this Errour continued the longer, becauſe it crept in under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of, 1. <hi>Zeal to the glory of God:</hi> and, 2. Of <hi>Detestation</hi> of <hi>ſin.</hi> Beware of ſuch Errours as enter with the faireſt pretences. 1. Nevertheleſs this Errour it was againſt the <hi>Scriptures</hi> evidently. 2. And it produced dangerous effects,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173117:40"/>for it advanced Satans kingdom, by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers into <hi>deſpair.</hi> 4. And it was condemned by the ſecond <hi>African</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel under <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> the Preſident thereof. And by the ſecond Synode at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there: See <hi>Euſebius, Alſted</hi> and <hi>Simpſon</hi> of the Church, <hi>Page</hi> 37.421, 422. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ And nevertheleſs theſe did not multiply their <hi>Errours;</hi> yet this <hi>Errour</hi> was a capital and dangerous one, and made way to others, and was obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted in to a great Schiſm, and dangerous, admitting no reclaim or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment: ſuch was their Independency: Though in other things they conſented with the Orthodox.</p>
            <p>☞ Hence they were condemned by <hi>ſome of Schiſm</hi> only; by others of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: So Schiſmaticks</hi> they were at the beſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is great Wiſdom to ſuppreſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours betimes which <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> endeavoured by their Colleagues, Synodes and Counſels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Authors of Schiſm</hi> are hinderers of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173117:41"/>reviving the Union of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Inveterates Schiſms</hi> often Turn to <hi>Hereſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhould beware of ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the unity of the Church under the pretence of piety and zeal.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that Invent-Remedies for the Churches Maladies which are worſe then the Diſeaſe, as the <hi>Novatians</hi> did by their opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> For though <hi>weakneſs</hi> is to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet a deviliſh <hi>Rigor</hi> pitying none that have fallen through infirmity, is a leſſon that hath no <hi>allowance</hi> in the book of God.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Novatians</hi> err; 1. in <hi>Schiſm.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſtinacy in errour.</hi> 3. Independency. 2.

He hatch'd a bitter hatred, (though cauſleſs) againſt <hi>Cecilianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whoſe cauſe was often heard. 2. But always the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſuccumbed (or fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173117:41"/>in proof. 3. In the end, becauſe they could not accompliſh their deſigns againſt <hi>Cecilianus;</hi> they became <hi>enraged,</hi> and, 1. <hi>Made a Schiſm</hi> falling off from the unity of the Church.</p>
            <p>

            <p>As for the Quarrel betwixt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and Presbitery, I could never ſee other cauſe, then in the Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, which if laid aſide, the difference might ſoon be decided, and the Controverſie ended: For I could never find but that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is a <hi>Presbytery</hi> elevated and advanced. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Presbytery rightly managed, is an Epiſcopacy regulated: Nor could I ever approve the total rejecting of the names <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> they being ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſed in the New Teſtament, and the name <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſo honoured by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that He himſelf is ſtyled, the great chief Shepherd, and Biſhop of our ſouls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the point, and proof thereof, with Reaſons ſuited to the ten particulars contained therein: We are upon Uſe; and you have heard the firſt Uſe anſwerable to the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which hath, 1.

               <hi>Field, Vine, Houſe,</hi> the Church of God, that it be not wrong'd by any Enemy. 2. Exhorted us to conſider the charge often impoſed upon us <hi>to that end,</hi> Act. 20 28, to 33. And how praiſe worthy the Primitive Fathers, the <hi>Orthodox party</hi> in after-ages, and the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of Chriſtendome have been, and are for thus doing. 3. Reproved, as very faulty, all ſuch as neglect this care of prevention, or hinder the <hi>Church</hi> of the means of recovery out of <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> if the Church ſhould be ſick of ſuch <hi>Maladies,</hi> as often: Thus do, 1. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> 2. <hi>Antient Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as <hi>Novatians, Donatiſts.</hi> 3.

            <p n="1">1. What they ſay againſt the Civil Power over the Church, is evident.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> (though they may ſeem to advance it in external pomp, great Honours, plentiful proviſions <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet they have overthrown the right office, beſt Uſe, powerful Efficacy of it for the converſion of ſouls; by,</p>

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming them with the vileſt names of <hi>Baals-Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. to render them infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and odious to all men.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:173117:51"/>
            <p>I have done with the firſt Uſe from the firſt particular of the Doctrine, which contains above a whole ſheet of paper: The weight of the matter ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, did juſtly occaſion that prolixity) I ſhall be more ſpeedy in the reſt which now ſucceed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe is from the ſecond and third particulars of the point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Informs us of our own weakneſs and nakedneſs. Alas, what can we do without this ſtrength in the Lord, and Armour of God. 1. Other ſtrength meerly humane, though very puiſſant; And, 2. Other Armour of exquiſite compoſure and ſtrength hath often fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in wars with man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As all the Routs and Overthrows of the <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Gods Enemies</hi> mentioned in Scripture, as of <hi>Siſera, Ethiopians,</hi> &amp;c. againſt <hi>Aſa, Johoſhaphat,</hi> over <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> over <hi>Aſſyrrians.</hi> 2. And the Downfal of <hi>Goliah,</hi> that mighty Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion armed with ſtrength, and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Weapons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. do evidently teſtifie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But to act with humane ſtrength,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173117:51"/>and ſuch inconſiderable Armour againſt a <hi>ſpiritual enemy</hi> the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> could ſay, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. <hi>By ſtrength ſhall none prevail:</hi> were as <hi>Ridiculous an abſurdity,</hi> as an <hi>infallible impoſsibility</hi> of ever prevailing at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore as we are oft exhorted, 1. How ſhould we call, and cry out for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id and ſtrength of the Lord to help us in theſe Aſſaults, <hi>For he is our ſtrength and power,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. and <hi>David</hi> a great Warrior, and other Worthies do acknowledge. 2. And <hi>Gird up the loins of our minds, and let our lights be burning,</hi> Luke 12.35. <hi>To be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to execute our charge with the oyl of repentance, Faith and Charity in our lamps</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>with watchfulneſs, Sobriety, Hope and Truth;</hi> All which is obtained by <hi>Faith in Chriſt:</hi> By which we overcome the 1. <hi>World,</hi> 1 John 5.4, 5. 2. The <hi>Devil</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. 3. <hi>All Evil,</hi> Revel. 12.10, 11, 17. By the blood of the Lamb, and word of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and all becauſe Chriſt hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. and hath given us the victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:173117:52"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And by faith in him we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his ſtrength, victory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But how faulty are we, for which we are juſtly to be blamed and reproved.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For that we neither look out, nor take pains for this ſtrength and aid by, 1. <hi>Prayers, ſtrong cryes:</hi> And, 2. <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance, waiting,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1, 2, 3. <hi>Patiently,</hi> as the Saints did of old. The Church did ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. and 33.2. <hi>For to ſuch is the promiſe,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. Hab. 2.3. <hi>It will come.</hi> 1. But rather ſeek to <hi>King Jareb,</hi> as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, Hoſ. 5.13. 2. And reſt upon others, as too many have done, and do: 3. Or Evil things; which cannot profit us, nor ſtand us in ſtead at our greateſt need, as I have told them out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.8. See the Notes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Nor do we lay out for this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or take pains to put it on, but rather chooſe to ſtand naked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed before our enemies, as it was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.21.25. and befel <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.8. 1. For that we will not accept Armour when it is offered to us. 2. And are ready to caſt away our Weapons and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173117:52"/>Arms when we have them upon us, and in our hands, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Achan</hi> did by Idolatry, and that treſpaſs, as before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But laſtly, which would be our everlaſtling comfort:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Were we as careful to get the ſtrength of God to our aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> As we are to gain men to aid us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And to gird up the loins of our mind,</hi> and to put on Chriſt, and the <hi>armour</hi> of God for our defence:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> As we are to arm our ſelves with earthly armour againſt our real or ſuppoſed earthly enemies, we were happy therein, and might take abundant comfort in that God that ſtrengthens us, and that Lord Jeſus Chriſt in whom we believe, who will ſave us in the end.</p>
            <p>The third Uſe is from the 4.5.6. and 7. particulars of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Informs us what need we have of Wiſdom and Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Serpentine wiſdom,</hi> Mat. 10.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More then <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And of <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> army of <hi>Angels,</hi> 2 King. 6.16, 17. to help againſt ſo many
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173117:53"/>Wiles, ſuch ſtrong aſſaults, ſuch infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers, and deviliſh adverſaries, as are all acting againſt us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many are the Wiles, and Snares, and depths of Satan; and who is it that can ſearch into the bottom of them to find out, and diſcover them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many alſo are the Inſtruments by which he worketh and undermines us: <hi>viz.</hi> 1 By <hi>ſeeming friends.</hi> 2. <hi>Domeſtick ſervants.</hi> 3. <hi>Falſe brethren.</hi> and, 4. He can transform himſelf and his Miniſters into Angels of Light, to make all his ſtratagems take the better effect: ſo that whither he do, 1. Enſnare us by <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Doctrines</hi> under faireſt pretences, as to many: Or, 2. Aſſaults us with viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous provocations, as with a pleaſing Bait, like a <hi>Nimrod</hi>-like Hunter, or crafty Fowler, or dangerous Fiſher after mens ſouls to deſtroy them: yet ſtill his care is that his labour be not loſt, but that all may take effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſtances,</hi> 1. Thus he acted of old by the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who beguiled Iſrael with their Wiles, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.27. Their pleaſing perſwaſions to vitious actions, with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173117:53"/>which they are ſaid to vex them, becauſe hereby they cauſed God to vex them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And thus by <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that filthy Propheteſſe, who did teach and ſeduce men to <hi>Fornication,</hi> &amp;e. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20. to 25. And theſe practiſes are there called, <hi>the depths of Satan,</hi> verſe 25. But mark her doom there, <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Like Prophets and Propheteſſes have been in theſe times, <hi>Edwards</hi> Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green. and no doubt but in due time God will reward them accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now ſurely a man thus beſet, ſurrounded with Wiles and Snares, 1. Had need to have <hi>Serpentine-like wiſdom,</hi> and more: It is our Saviours advice and councel to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. <hi>To be wiſe as Serpents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Serpents are reported to be wiſe in four reſpects, of which, 1. Two are <hi>prudentious:</hi> 2. And other two, moſt <hi>pernicious..</hi> 1. The <hi>Trudentious proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Serpents wiſdom,</hi> are, 1. <hi>A ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obſerving,</hi> and knowing things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. 2. <hi>To avoid dangers, by flying, hiding,</hi> and ſecuring themſelves.</p>
            <p>In theſe the Diſciples were to imitate the Serpents Wiſdom; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:173117:54"/>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>wiſely obſerving, and prudently ſearching</hi> out the knowledge of things by their <hi>experiences,</hi> which though it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>M<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. Stultorum,</hi> yet may it be as truly named <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. &amp; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sapientum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Flying, hiding, and ſecuring</hi> themſelves from dangers by all lawful means. 1. Save your ſelves from this untoward <hi>generation, Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> perverſe and wicked men. 2. When they perſecute you in one City, flee into another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.23. 3. Thus Chriſt himſelf did. 4. And others, <hi>Athana ſius.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To deceive and ſeduce, and ſo the old Serpent ſeduced and beguiled, 1. <hi>Eve,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.13. and in her, the root of all makind; His deceitful poyſon hath infected all the branches. 2. As the <hi>Crocadiles</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> with her tears. 3. And other Serpents by Wiles do deceive them, whom afterwards they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To wound mortally with a poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſting, as it is uſual.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:173117:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And in theſe the godly muſt not only beware leſt they be beguiled by him, but alſo act contrary to him, (ſince he is ſo wiſe in his generation to deceiva and deſtroy) and that two ways; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By <hi>alluring men to that which is good,</hi> and winning them to be healed of ſin, as the Apoſtle did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. 2. <hi>Let us undeceive, and direct men, wounding men with godly ſorrow,</hi> (never to be repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of) <hi>that they may beſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> All theſe are a deadly ſting to the Devil him ſelf, and to all his Agents, that the godly can either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Know (by experience) his Wiles.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Or wound them for ſin unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that they may be ſaved, <hi>God is the healer of Iſrael,</hi> Mal. 4.2.</p>
            <p>☞.

            <p>Never were <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and others, that were to undertake great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Zorubbabel,</hi> &amp;c. upon a juſter cauſe, or better ground called upon to be ſtrong and couragious, and not to fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Then we are to be ſtrong and couragions in this ſpiritual Conflict. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.7, 8. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.6, 7, 9. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. <hi>ult. Jehoſhaphats</hi> counſel to them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. The Lords charge to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua, The Prince and high Prieſt to build the houſe of God, the Temple:</hi> and for our charge, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>hujus cap.</hi> and in the Text, <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong.</hi> In the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition before you hear, that this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courage is, 1. <hi>An undaunted boldneſs,</hi> or <hi>animoſity of heart.</hi> This is the Lords gift, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>I have made thy face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as an Adamant harder then flint.</hi> The rock fears no change of weather, heat
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173117:56"/>or cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the horſe fears no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Job</hi> 29.19. to 26. <hi>Clothed with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. And the Lyon turns not away from any, <hi>Prov</hi> 30.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So the Chriſtians Courage will not ſhrink, nor be danted, but by the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty, will bear up againſt all the ſtorms, and moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſaults of theſe terrible ones, the enemies named, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Subject of this courage, is a ſanctified heart: for as the heart is the ſubject of Courage both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſpiritual, <hi>&amp; eſt quaſi cordis actio,</hi> for ſo a valiant man is deſcribed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.26. <hi>His heart is as the heart of a Lion,</hi> cordatus vir, <hi>ſtrong of heart.</hi> So Sanctification is the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualification of this heart, in which ſpiritual courage dwells, by which it differs from other kinds of courage: This is the difference, and which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed by theſe three Notes, <hi>viz.</hi> the, 1. Root, whence it ſpringeth, <hi>viz. Love to God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Rule, by which it is directed, <hi>viz.</hi> The Word of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.12, 13.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:173117:56"/>
            <p n="3">3. End to which it referreth, <hi>viz.</hi> which <hi>David</hi> charged to <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon, and God he is the Centre to which, and wherein all things and undertakings of a ſanctified heart do refer and reſt, as every thing reſteth in his own proper Centre.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The object of this carriage about which it is imployed, is matters of great difficulty and hard ſervices: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33, 34, to 39. <hi>Who through Faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Kingdoms,</hi> &amp;c. Like their ſervice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.12. When the valiant men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> recovered the bodies of <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſons from the wall of <hi>Bethſhan,</hi> when there faſtened by the Philiſtines Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
            <p>So have many been reſcued from the mouth of Lions, and many ſouls from Hell by their Chriſtian Courage and fortitude againſt Satan, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. pluck'd out <hi>(quaſi)</hi> from the fire of Hell, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the fire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It muſt be always in a good cauſe, 1. <hi>In matters of faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>Stand faſt in the faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it.</hi> 2. And for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſake,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173117:57"/>1 Pet. 3.14. <hi>Then you are happy,</hi> The cauſe makes the Martyr not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Cauſa, non ſupplicium facit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ And it is a Chriſtian reſolution, and worthy of imitation, rather to run the hazard of whatſoever difficulties imaginable, the loſs of all that is dear and precious, life it ſelf, rather then to tranſgreſs the commands of God, violate my vows, <hi>wound</hi> my own conſcience, and make a breach between God and my own ſoul, which men care not for in theſe our days, ſo are they habituated in evil, and hardened in wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, Our courage muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a good warrant: the Call of God muſt be our ground of courage in any thing, God muſt ſay to us, as he did to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1.9. Have not I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee,? <hi>Be strong, and of a good courage,</hi> ſaith God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Gods Command is our only good warrant, but we act againſt it, and contrary to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> If all theſe particulars had been well obſerved for divers years laſt paſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173117:57"/>All which we have ſleighted for our own profit.) <hi>viz.</hi> If our <hi>Courage</hi> had been always ſeated in <hi>ſanctified hearts,</hi> and imployed in a <hi>good cauſe,</hi> and acted with <hi>good warrant</hi> from <hi>God</hi> in all our <hi>ſtreights</hi> and <hi>difficulties,</hi> ſure we had never fallen into the Confuſion we have felt, and been <hi>ingulfed</hi> in the Diviſions that have rent us to pieces; but we have taken another <hi>courſe,</hi> all for <hi>ſelf-ends,</hi> and have found croſs and contrary <hi>events</hi> to our expectation: juſtly ſo God is juſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reaſons</hi> or <hi>Motives</hi> that ſhould animate us to this <hi>Courage:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. God, who puts us upon this upon this work, and is our <hi>Leader, He is the Captain of the Lords Hoſt,</hi> Joſh. 5.14, 15. <hi>And of our own ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 2.10. <hi>Made perfect through ſufferings.</hi> God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all Chriſtians to be <hi>Soldiers</hi> againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and this we promiſe, and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (as by an <hi>oath</hi>) binds us hereunto, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſtiles <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> Soldiers; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. <hi>My brother, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in labour, and fellow-ſoldier</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173117:58"/>
               <hi>Timothy to endure hardneſs as a good Soldier of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.4.</p>
            <p>Soldiers we be, and <hi>Ergo</hi> muſt take Courage in this <hi>Warfare;</hi> Courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as neceſſary for a <hi>Soldier,</hi> as <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> for a <hi>Counſellour</hi> or <hi>Orator,</hi> and Learning for a <hi>Preacher,</hi> a Doctor to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The weighty <hi>ſervices</hi> which God imployes us in; and <hi>Ergo</hi> as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1.7. <hi>To be ſtrong and very couragious.</hi> And <hi>Joſhua</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that were to ſucceed him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.6. <hi>In conquering and ſubduing the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>and poſſeſsing the Land, &amp;c.</hi> which were matters of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> The like Counſel have we need to take in the works of,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Mortification,</hi> which muſt maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre our <hi>ſinful Iuſts,</hi> cut off, and pluck out eys, hands and feet in many caſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. and 18.8, 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 9, 43, to 49.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Demolition,</hi> &amp;c. levelling and battering down mountainous Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtrong holds, and fortifications
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173117:58"/>of <hi>ſin</hi> in our own boſoms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reparation</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and its Walls in our ſelves, as well as in our <hi>Nation,</hi> perſonally and publikly as we ought.</p>
            <p>See what pains they took, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.7, 8. All theſe muſt take courage: But what have we done to the contrary?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The many Enemies we have to encounter withal, <hi>viz.</hi> three huge <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of, 1. <hi>Devils.</hi> 2: <hi>Luſts.</hi> 3. <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world,</hi> all which do wage war with every Chriſtianin Heavens way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Devils;</hi> do but conſider how they are ſum'd up and ranked in the Text, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. eſpecially, <hi>Principalities, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Wiles, Aſſaults, Number, Power, mighty Oppoſition, and violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> I have ſpoken in the 5, 6, and 7. <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Luſts innumerable, which fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ſoul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. and ſtrike at the head and heart of our immortal ſouls, to captivate and kill us; See <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. How the Apoſtle complains.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>People, Beaſts in mens ſhapes,</hi> 1 Cor.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173117:59"/>15.32. Dogs, Lions, Bears, Bulls, Wolves and Tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>David</hi> calls them, and the Scripture ſtyles them uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Joab</hi> ſaw the Battle before and behind againſt him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9, 12. how did he encourage his Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And is it not ſo with us? <hi>Ergo,</hi> we had need to encourage one another in this dangerous War on all hands.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> we are like to meet with in this <hi>Warfare,</hi> which we ſhall never be able to undergo, if we have not <hi>Chriſtian Courage</hi> in our <hi>hearts.</hi> What <hi>ſad things</hi> may a Soldier of Chriſt ſee and feel, before we have a full and <hi>final</hi> victory, as thoſe Worthies did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36.37, 39.</p>
            <p>Thus doth this third Uſe informs us from the 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Reaſons,</hi> what need we have of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Courage, that we may be able to withſtand</hi> ſuch mighty and <hi>crafty Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And how this Uſe doth ſerve to reprove <hi>many</hi> for their <hi>Cowardlineſs</hi> in things evidently good for us and others. Like them, <hi>John</hi> 12.42, 43. <hi>For they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173117:59"/>loved the praiſe of men,</hi> &amp;c. and becauſe of the <hi>hardſhip</hi> that ſometimes doth <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> good Actions. Like them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Chriſt did not ſo in the work of our Redemption, He feared not men, nor favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe ſhould do well to conſider, what and where ſuch fearful perſons <hi>ſhall have a ſhare,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>But the fearful,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have part in the lake,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Audaciouſneſs</hi> in evil, againſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be ſaid to the contrary: This is not courage, but hardneſs. Like them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>That made their faces and hearts harder then a rock. Adamant,</hi> Zach. 7.12. This is contrary to <hi>Cowardlineſs;</hi> yet both theſe are enemies to Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and juſtly blamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> that durſt encounter with a Lion, a Bear, a Giant, <hi>(Goliah)</hi> yet trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth with fear of God, and of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Pſulm</hi> 119.120. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34, to 38. But <hi>David</hi> like men are dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> The Grandees of our Age are of another mind, <hi>who neither fear God, nor regard man:</hi> Like him, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.2. <hi>But I do leave them, and all ſuch to their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doom.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:173117:60"/>
            <p>And to what hath been ſpoken <hi>already,</hi> by way of Motive before, let me add this <hi>Exhortation</hi> to <hi>animate</hi> us in this true Chriſtian Courage againſt our ſpiritual and ſpightful Adverſary, by ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which are drawn from,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Commodities</hi> accruing by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Courage, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Favour of God,</hi> to ſtrengthen you, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.14. <hi>Be of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will give heart in the hardeſt <hi>Adventures,</hi> as it did to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Eſter,</hi> whoſe task was hard.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will make us unwearied in our works, and make them eaſie, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſo frequent meſſages to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It will prevent ſinful and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>miſcarriages,</hi> as it did in the three Children and <hi>Daniel,</hi> had they not been couragious, as to the hazard of life, how had they miſcarried!</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will daunt our Adverſaries, for as <hi>James</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And encourage others, as <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds did many, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="2">II. From the ſad conſequences of Cowardlineſs in this caſe.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:173117:60"/>
            <p n="1">1. Perſonal diſcredit, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.13. as <hi>Samballat</hi> would have done to <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes us unſerviceable, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.25. as that ſlothful ſervant was, and fore-caſteth difficulties, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.13. and 26.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It brings damage to good cauſes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.18. ſo <hi>Rabſhakah</hi> would have frighted <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to that end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It expoſeth us to Sin and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in St. <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Prophet muſt not be diſmayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It animateth the Adverſary.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It diſcourageth others.</p>
            <p>Therefore to help us to courage in this Conflict.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Secure your propriety in God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And the goodneſs of the Cauſe, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the weighty conſequences of a good cauſe, elſe we ſhall be Slaves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Have an eye upon Chriſt your Leader in this Conflict, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Keep mutual Communion one with another, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.15.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:173117:61"/>
            <p n="6">6. Set Faith on work, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. and the more, becauſe of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, which to do, conſider the promiſe of, 1. Gods Aſſiſtance, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.14. 2. Good ſucceſs, as <hi>John</hi> 1.6. and <hi>John</hi> 26.33. <hi>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</hi> 3. Recompence to men reſolute in good.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Enlarge your Love, for Love worketh much in, 1. Feeble women. 2. In fearful Ewes for their Children, their Lambs. 3. <hi>Jacobs</hi> hard ſervice was ſhort, and eaſie upon this ſcore.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Keep a clear Conſcience, this will make a man bold and couragious.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Improve Experiences, theſe will add much confidence to courage.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Go on in this ſpiritual Combare ſelf-denyingly, in the ſtrength of God, as <hi>verſe</hi> 10. before. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 20.6, 7, 8. <hi>But</hi> (Pſalm 68.17, 18.) <hi>the Chariots of God are twenty thouſand thouſands of Angels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he hath led Captivity captive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed three Uſes from the firſt ſeven particulars of the point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uſe informs us of the great danger
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:173117:61"/>the <hi>Church</hi> is in, becauſe of the <hi>Tares, Hereſies, Errours</hi> and <hi>Schiſms,</hi> which, 1. <hi>Apostate Romaniſts.</hi> 2. Antient <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And, 3. Modern <hi>Separatiſts</hi> (<hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi>) have ſown, and by them greatly corrupted, and diſturbed the Churches Doctrine, Unity, Peace and Concord, <hi>p.</hi> 13.2. to 22.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Uſe from the ſecond and third parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, informs us of the <hi>Churches weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to withſtand ſuch Adverſaries by her own ſtrength, <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Uſe informs us what need the Church hath of both <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> to reſiſt ſuch mighty Enemies.</p>
            <p>You may remember the Doctrine (which is comprehenſive of this, and the three former <hi>verſes</hi>) as it is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Church</hi> when at the <hi>beſt.</hi> 2. Had <hi>need</hi> to be <hi>ſtrong</hi> in the Lord. 3. And compleatly <hi>armed.</hi> 4. <hi>To ſtand</hi> and <hi>withſtand.</hi> 5. <hi>Manifold Wiles.</hi> 6. And <hi>mighty Aſſaults.</hi> 7. Of ſo <hi>many</hi> and <hi>potent Enemies.</hi> 8.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173117:62"/>2. Without. 9. And eſpecially in the <hi>Evil day.</hi> 10. And yet that ſhe may <hi>ſtand</hi> and remain victorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over all in the end when all is done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This point hath been fully proved by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. And three Uſes are finiſhed, which inform us of, 1. The <hi>Great danger that the Church is in,</hi> becauſe of Hereſies, Errours and Schiſms of <hi>Apoſtates, Romaniſts, Antient Hereticks, Modern Separatists.</hi> 2.

            <p>Now becauſe <hi>theſe Enemies</hi> do ſtorm us both within and without: Let me add a fourth Uſe conſiſting of two Branches, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>How miſtruſtful</hi> we ſhould be of our own hearts within us. 2.

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> And great Reaſon we have ſo to be, if we do but conſider, what the Lord ſpeaketh by the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> which ſentence containeth a lively deſcription of the great pravity, and deep corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in our hearts. Heart is here put for the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> as uſually, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. and 5.24. And all its parts, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections:</hi> For the whole inward man, the corrupt <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of which is very hard to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or known, either by, 1.

            <p>The expreſſion of the Prophet is very ſignificant: where, 1. The heart is put for the mind and ſoul, with all its parts. <hi>Hallebh guacobh.</hi> 2. <hi>Deceitful,</hi> wily, fraudulent, prone to ſupplant, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and deceive, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.4. every bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſupplant, or trip up his heels. And <hi>Jehu</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.10. Hence

               <hi>Jacob</hi> had his name from holding his brother by the heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.26. and 27.36. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.3. Or it ſignifies alſo <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, full of pravity, crooked</hi> and <hi>uneven,</hi> as ways full of windings and turnings, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> hard to find.</p>

               <hi>Ap.</hi> So it is with mans heart, full of <hi>windings, Turnings, Nooks</hi> and <hi>Corners, Wiles</hi> and <hi>Sleights,</hi> Iſa. 29.15, 16. <hi>Wo to them that ſeek deep, that will pretend one thing, intend another, and inwardly purpoſe quite contrary to what the tongue, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage, and behaviour doth pretend and promiſe,</hi> Pſalm 31.6. and 55.13, 14.20.21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> We have had experience enough of this. 3. <hi>Above all things,</hi> (Miccol, prae omnibus) or <hi>perſons above ought:</hi> It is ſo ſly and wily, that no creature in wicked ſubtilty and diſſembling, can go beyond it. 4. And <hi>deſperately wicked, (Ve Anuſh Hu, Et Anxium ipſum)</hi> it is but one word in the Text, and is diverſly rendred, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

               <hi>Ap.</hi> How many in our days have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the deſperate wickedneſs of their hearts by their practiſes. 5. <hi>Who can know it?</hi> Surely none but God, to whom alone the Prophet aſcribes this Excellency, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart,</hi> Jer. 17.9, 10. <hi>Not others,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Nor we our ſelves,</hi> Pſalm 19.12.

            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>All Chriſtians that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors over ſpiritual Enemies, muſt be girded,</hi> that is, <hi>ſtrengthned with truth,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>With Chriſt:</hi> 2. <hi>Sound Doctrine.</hi> 3. <hi>A ſincere Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me take theſe aſunder, and look upon them ſeveral apart.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We muſt be girded with Chriſt: 1. God himſelf is ſaid, <hi>To be girded with power and ſtrength,</hi> Pſalm 65.6. and 93.1.2. And <hi>Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to be girded with his ſword,</hi> of Might, Glory and Majeſty, and ſo to ride proſperouſly, <hi>Becauſe of Truth, Meekneſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſalm 45.3, 4, to 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> He alludeth to <hi>Princes</hi> that in their Triumph rid in Chariots, ſhewing, <hi>that the quiet State</hi> (peace and proſperity) <hi>of a Kingdom or Nation,</hi> ſtandeth in <hi>Truth, Meekneſs, juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:173117:76"/>in worldly pomp or vanity, much leſs in Robbery, Oppreſſion and Tyranny, as our Nation of late hath done. 3. So alſo we muſt be girded with Chriſt, <hi>who is the Truth:</hi> He is the firſt piece of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Armour for <hi>ſafety,</hi> and the beſt <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel</hi> for our Honour, Dignity and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both are conjoyned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>For Chriſt is made to us Wiſdom and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as <hi>Apparrel</hi> for <hi>Dignity, Beauty, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> as Armour for Safety, Satisfaction and Security.</p>
            <p>Ap. <hi>If the Sanctification of Chriſt be our Apparrel,</hi> we are ſo clad, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arons</hi> Robes, <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> Miter, and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai's</hi> Royal Apparrel are not like it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Eſther</hi> 6.8. to 12.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt</hi> be our <hi>Armour,</hi> then are we girt with <hi>Armour</hi> of proof <hi>utriuſque,</hi> the <hi>armour</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> on the right hand and on the left, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Armour</hi> may well be ſtyled <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive</hi> indeed by which we are ſaved from <hi>Gods diſpleaſure, Rom.</hi> 5.1. and from Satans Malice and Violence. 2. <hi>As</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:173117:77"/>alſo <hi>active</hi> and <hi>infuſive,</hi> ſo as that it puts <hi>valour</hi> into the man that wears it, as it did into the <hi>Worthies of old,</hi> the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> of all <hi>ages,</hi> who could not have ſtood in the time of trial, had they not been <hi>Girded</hi> with this <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> 3. Yea it may well be ſaid to be <hi>Offenſive</hi> alſo, for being girded with this, we do as eaſily <hi>conquer</hi> the devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Goliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Being thus <hi>apparrelled, we are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like unto the Kings daughter,</hi> Pſalm 45.13, 14. Or that woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. with the Sun, the Moon under, a crown of twelve ſtars; and who can deſire better? 2. And being thus <hi>armed</hi> and girded about with the ſtrength of Chriſt, <hi>we are as ſafe as Mount Sion</hi> that is envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with Mountains, and cannot be removed, but abideth for ever, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 125.1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> It is no marvel therefore though we be often called upon, <hi>To put on the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 13.14. <hi>The new man,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24 Col 3.10. 3. And on the contrary, without this, how naked and unſafe are we? obvious to all manner of ignominy and danger.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:173117:77"/>
            <p>And as this <hi>Military Belt</hi> or <hi>Girdle</hi> doth extend, 1. <hi>To Chriſt, the fountain of Truth:</hi> So alſo doth it, 2. <hi>To ſound Doctrine, the Word of God,</hi> which Chriſt in his Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. ſpeaks of: <hi>The Goſpel of Christ,</hi> Gal. 2.5. Col. 1.5. This leads us to the old way, it being the old rule, and is the form of ſound ſpeech, and the light to which we ſhould look for our direction in all things.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>And to ſincerity of life:</hi> All which together are fitly reſembled by a Sealing; in which there is, 1. <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</hi> 2. <hi>Recipiens.</hi> 3. <hi>Sigillum impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi> The <hi>Seal is the Word,</hi> God ſets it on, and we receive the character of it; and the more exactly we anſwer the <hi>print</hi> of the <hi>Seal, the Word of God,</hi> by ſo much the more <hi>Truth</hi> is in us, and <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt is of his Father,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>Who is the expreſs Image or character of his perſon;</hi> This we ſhould buy, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23.23. as a moſt deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commodity: <hi>Reaſons</hi> are, becauſe God loves it: It is a Ray of him, a beam of his brightneſs, it is our Glory to be like the Standard, and our gain, <hi>It
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173117:78"/>brings peace with it, Zach.</hi> 8.16.20. We have need of it in ſuch a falſe <hi>age,</hi> and where it is wanting, all Evils both of ſin and puniſhment do abound, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe:</hi> Reproof to all ſuch as will be at no pains or coſt to get it, ſuch as love ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conceal, betray, know, yet do not the truth, ſuch as are enemies to it, 1. in others, as <hi>Ahab, Zedekiah,</hi> proud men, <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, Phariſees, the world to Chriſt, and the <hi>Galatians</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and, 2. in themſelves in Opinion, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. in practiſe, Hypocrites that diſſemble it, prophane Neglecters that are careleſs, and graceleſs Contemners of the truth, that wilfully refuſe it: and, 2. And how many are very eaſie to part with this Girdle of truth, either weakly through fear of perſecution, as <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Ecebolus, Spira,</hi> Love of the world, as <hi>Demas, Caraciolus</hi> and <hi>Urillas,</hi> Or wilfully, as <hi>Hereticks, Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarily,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> his Maſter, &amp; <hi>Eſau</hi> his birth-right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Baſely</hi> and fooliſhly, as thoſe who for their vices, luſts, will ſell all.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:173117:78"/>
            <p>☞ Should I proſecute theſe things, you ſhall ſcarce find in Hiſtory an <hi>age</hi> more falſe then this; Heads, Hearts, Hands, Tongues, Councels, Conſciences, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and Practiſes: All falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of all theſe ſee my Notes upon <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 23.23. <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You have heard at large the drift of the Apoſtles Exhortation, to withſtand our ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. We are now upon an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which contains an <hi>Enumeration</hi> of the ſeveral pieces or parts of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Armour, with which we muſt be furniſhed to ſtand in this combate, and to conquer; the particulars you know are ſeven, <hi>viz. Defenſive</hi> and <hi>Offenſive,</hi> I have diſpatcht the firſt, <hi>viz. the Girdle of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I do now deſcend to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> There is little difficulty in the words; Every man (I preſume) knows what a <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> and what <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exp.</hi> Only thus much let me give you notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Breaſt-plate as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173117:79"/>it is uſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is 1. <hi>Military,</hi> as you know it is uſual for Soldiers to arm themſelves with that piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which ſerves for defence of the <hi>Breaſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Myſtical,</hi> Rev. 9.9. Thoſe <hi>Scorpion-like Locuſts,</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> had ſtrongly armed themſelves and their Kingdom, that their <hi>Foes</hi> might not hurt them. 3. <hi>Sacred,</hi> as that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron,</hi> Exod. 28.15, 30. Lev. 8.8. In which was the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummin,</hi> light and perfection, and which is called the <hi>Breaſt-plate of Judgement,</hi> becauſe it did denote the <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> &amp; the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> or integrity which the Prieſt ſhould have, and the care he ſhould take to anſwer them in <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> who asked or enquired of God by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> This <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummin</hi> was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the primitive Times in the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Propheſie, Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 2. but moſt tranſendently eminent in Chriſt, in whom this <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummin</hi> was fulfilled, becauſe <hi>In Him,</hi> John 4.9, 17. and 3.34. Col. 2.3. <hi>are all the Treaſures, and by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to us,</hi> John 1.16. and 14.16, 17.4.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:173117:79"/>
               <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as here in the Text; and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Let us be ſober, putting on the breaſt-plate of Faith and Love;</hi> and by this <hi>breaſt-plate</hi> is ſignified a <hi>Good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is the only fence for the <hi>heart, Hic murus aheneus esto, nil conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſibi, nulla palleſcere culpa,</hi> Hor. as alſo good <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs,</hi> theſe are our Lamps, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. <hi>To be held,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. as <hi>Thorax munit pectus militis,</hi> ſo do theſe our lives that we ſin not, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. and 3.9. This kept <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſalm 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the Explication of the word <hi>Breast-plate;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Now for the next word, <hi>viz. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> Obſerve that it is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural;</hi> This we had in our firſt Creation, <hi>For God made man righteous, He being created after Gods own image,</hi> and proportionably as Chriſt was, <hi>who after God was created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. But this we quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Legal,</hi> the Righteouſneſs of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:173117:80"/>Law often mentioned by the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. and 8.4. and 10.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But this we could never perform unto perfection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Civil,</hi> which is by <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and conſiſting in the <hi>juſt dealing among men in word and deed,</hi> and is called <hi>Equity, Honeſty, Right</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and this was in, 1. <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14.23. and 23.16. <hi>in taking and paying.</hi> 2. <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 30.33. <hi>In his dealing with</hi> Laban <hi>about wages,</hi> &amp;c. 3. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the <hi>Princes,</hi> Joſh. 9 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26. <hi>About the Covenant which they made with the</hi> Gibeonites; for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, and for ſlaying them, <hi>Sauls</hi> bloody houſe ſmarted, <hi>and all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael by a three years famine,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.1, 6, to 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But men of our times have no Conſcience of any Covenant, or any branch of civil Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and this is either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or imparted.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Imputed,</hi> whereby Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is become ours; Rom. 4, 6, 11. and 5.18. <hi>So by the Righteouſneſs of one,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:173117:80"/>the gift is upon all to juſtification of life:</hi> and this is called the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1. Of <hi>Faith,</hi> Rom 4.11, 13. 2. Of <hi>God,</hi> Rom. 3.21, 22. <hi>without the Law, by faith of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Of God by faith,</hi> ibid. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Not having mine own,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by which we are juſtified, and made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.1, 19.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Imparted,</hi> and becomes inherent in our ſelves; and it is a Conformity of our Will, Affections and Actions unto Gods holy Will and Law, <hi>according to the meaſure of Grace received from Chriſt by the work of the holy Spirit:</hi> Thus we become, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> The former is Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18 <hi>Upon all men unto,</hi> &amp;c. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is our <hi>Sanctification, By which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſervants of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.18. and both theſe may be ſaid to be, 1. <hi>Privative,</hi> in the removal of ſin and unrighteouſneſs. 2. <hi>Poſitive,</hi> both by imputation of Chriſt, and infuſion of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:173117:81"/>Grace. 3. <hi>Gradual,</hi> as the meaſure and degrees of it come on. 4. <hi>Intenſive,</hi> when we ſtrive for more. 5. <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> in reſpect of others, as <hi>Noah, Lot, Iob, David, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. all which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſet forth, <hi>Can.</hi> 6.10. The words thus cleared, do afford this point,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſts Soldiers that fight againſt Satan and ſpiritual enemies, muſt have on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>they muſt be righteous, upright, a ſincere hearted people, keeping a good Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c:</p>
            <p>To this point I have lately ſpoken ſomething, <hi>viz.</hi> March 7. 1659. out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. at Mr. <hi>Warners</hi> Funeral, I ſhall therefore only name the heads and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of things ſpoken, and proceed: and this for them that heard me not at that time.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſts Soldiers muſt keep righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, uprightneſs, and a good conſcience cloſe to their hearts:</hi> This point for the ſubſtance of it, I then proved by,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Scripture,</hi> for God hath oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.1. To <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 18.13. and to them again
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173117:81"/>by <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.14. and commended it in many, as in <hi>David, Aſa, Nathauiel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Reaſons,</hi> becauſe in ſuch Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is renewed; there is a conformity to Chriſt, and ſuch have received the ſpirit of Sanctification, which heals Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies, and natural unrighteouſneſs to this proof I then added ſundry mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and marks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Motives,</hi> this is heart-circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the beginning of ſoundneſs, the Moraliſt minds the Out-ſide, <hi>God</hi> only <hi>cures</hi> the <hi>heart;</hi> This looks out in every action, as a Candle in a Lant-horn at every pane. All Shwes and Pretences are nothing without this. The Prayers of ſuch are acceptable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. Gods delight. <hi>God delighteth in ſuch,</hi> Pſalm 51.6.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Marks,</hi> whereby to try your ſelves
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:173117:82"/>upon a uſe of Examination: 1. Make Gods Word our Rule: this will rectifie us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.8, 9. <hi>And they are bleſſed that walk by it,</hi> Pſalm 119.1, 2. a. Love all good, hate all ſins as well as ſome: <hi>

Be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as well as prayerful, not like them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.34, to 38. Vow and pay, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and perform, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 6.

Be uniform, ſtill a like in good, at home, abroad, in the family, field, in publick, private, in dangerous times, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.1. 8.

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:173117:82"/>119 34.80. that all Matter, Manner, Ends, Continuance may be right in you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> If we find theſe Characters of uprightneſs in our hearts and lives, we may then chear our ſelves in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whether God ſift us, as <hi>Amos</hi> 9.9. yet we may ſay as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139 23 24. or the world, as it did <hi>Daniel,</hi> 6 45. or Satan, as he did <hi>Job</hi> 27 5 6 and 3: 6: and <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22 31 32.

And thus the Prophets and Apoſtles did back their Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reproofs with many impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments. Thus Conſcience ſhould do in all, but (alas for grief) How is it put away, ſtifled, and ſhipwrackt in moſt, and become,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorant,</hi> ſo that it cannot, nor will not ſee to diſtinguiſh Colours, but calls <hi>good evil, and evil good.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Forgetful</hi> of our faults, gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but of fifty for an hundred, like the unjuſt Steward, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.6.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely no, Conſcience will be awakned, and then it will be a woful day to wicked men.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This Uſe of Reproof doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf to all wicked, unrighteous and unjuſt perſons, who though they know, that God hath ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Righteouſneſs, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as the manifeſt duty of the ſecond Table in that ſhort abridgement of both the Tables of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is Good, and what the Lord requires,</hi> &amp;c. That the Lord himſelf is righteous, and hat he loveth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and <hi>Righteouſneſs, and that his eys</hi> (of favour) <hi>are upon them,</hi> Pſalm 34.15. And that better is a little with righteouſneſs, then a great deal more, (they know) then I need repeat, yet they will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon unjuſt and unrighteous ways: For how many mens Houſes, See <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.13, to 20.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:173117:84"/>Lands, like <hi>Nahoths</hi> vineyard in <hi>Ahabs</hi> poſſeſſion. Eſtates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.13, 14. See the Treaſury of the Tyrants of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and Proviſions; How many mens words and works do teſtifie to mens faces their unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap</hi> Of all which the Prophet hath ſpoken abundantly, and we alſo now can teſtifie and evidence the unrighteouſneſs of mens hearts and hands in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der takings and proceedings.</p>
            <p>☞ Sure they conſider not <hi>that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it,</hi> Rom. 1.18. <hi>And that ſuch ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>And in the end ſhall periſh, and receive the reward of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is ſo much ſpoken in Scripture againſt thoſe eminent Trees in the Garden of God, that did ſo flouriſh and overſpread, and cauſed ſo much terrour in the land of the living, <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:173117:85"/>amongſt the people of God, that ſuch may not only ſee cauſe to tremble, but alſo foreſee, that they ſhall wither, and fall, and periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus concerning this ſecond piece of <hi>Armour,</hi> viz. the <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, you have heard the kinds of <hi>Breaſt-plates,</hi> 1. Military: 2. Myſtical: 4. Sacred: 5. Spiritual, and that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is either Natural, Legal, Civil or Evangelical, and what Righteouſneſs is moſt applyable to this piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Then you had the point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, proved by Scripture, thre <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> promoted further by ſix motives, and demonſtrated by evident ſignes or marks of Uprightneſs; all which did conduce, contribute to, and complete the firſt Uſe of Exhortation: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Uſe of Reproof to ſuch as dream of perfection in this life, as grieve and wrong the righteous for Righteouſneſs-ſake, as put away, and make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a good Conſcience, as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe unrighteouſneſs in their ſtations and converſations, theſe may expect the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173117:85"/>righteous judgement of God againſt them.</p>
            <p>Now to cloſe this part of Armour with a word of comfort, the third <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is of Conſolation to all righteous perſons: obſerve that, 1 God is righteous, and loveth righteouſneſs. 2 His eys are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>righteous</hi> for their good. 3 His promiſes made to ſuch are innumerable. 4 His performance is ſure. 5 Their peace of Conſcience is unſpeakable. 6 Their life is comfortable. 7 Such can attend their great account with confidence. 8 And their death-bed pangs are tolerable, and do revive in them the hope of Heaven. 9 They die in expectation of a glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 10 And after death there is a reward from them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 58.11. A voice from heaven ſhall ſay, <hi>Open the gates,</hi> &amp;c, and it ſhall be with them as with the wiſe Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Then ſhall the righteous ſhine as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3.</p>
            <p>Touching this Chriſtian Warfare, which doth ſo much concern all, you
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:173117:86"/>you know the Apoſtles Counſel in this Chapter, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. to 19. in nine Verſes, doth conſiſt, 1. Of an Exhortation, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to 14. <hi>to put on our armour.</hi> 2. An Information of the parts of our ſpiritual armour, conſiſting of an <hi>enumeration</hi> of the ſeveral particular pieces neceſſary for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> The former of theſe I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with the thirteenth Uſe, I am now upon the ſecond, and have already ſpoken of two pieces of our ſpiritual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Belt</hi> or Girdle: and, 2. <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> which I diſmiſſed with the former <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Verſe</hi> doth preſent us with a third piece of Armour, <hi>viz. And their feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi> For the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, take a view of the words; The Apoſtle doth proceed with elegant Metaphors. Alluſions and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes taken from Soldiers preparations for War.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Feet</hi> in the natural ſenſe and uſe, you are well acquainted with, that they are the loweſt members of the body, by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173117:86"/>which it is carried about from place to place, and are the Inſtruments of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, 4. Angels. <hi>John</hi> 1.35. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Iſrael paſſed on their feet,</hi> &amp;c. And hence it was ſo uſual with them to waſh their feet after travail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But <hi>ſigurative, Feet</hi> are uſually put in Scripture for, 1. <hi>The whole man:</hi> Rom. 3.15. and 10.15. <hi>Swift to ſhed blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.101, 105. <hi>My feet from every evil way.</hi> 2. The Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Deſires, Care, Purpoſes, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Actions: <hi>Prov,</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet, that thou ſlip not.</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 5.1. <hi>Keep they foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Our ſlips and ſins of infirmity; in which ſenſe our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 13.10. <hi>He that is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe, the word <hi>Feet</hi> is uſed for the feet and legs up to the knees: and in this ſenſe we know, it was, and is uſual for men to arm their feet and legs with greaves of braſs, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.6. to ward his Shins from darts, blows and thruſts; or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173117:87"/>or elſe with Boots or Shooes, according to the kind of imployment, Military or Civil, that men are uſually exerciſed in on horſeback or on foot in their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>In the three figurative ſenſes named, the phraſe is properly applyable to the words of the Text, and the matter in hand. 1. If the Will and Affections (as Feet) the beginners of motion and action. 2. And the whole man be thus furniſhed and ſhod as here. 3. Then they will be the better able to withſtand the mighty enemies before named, yea, and their own failings, ſlips and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and to ſtand in this Warfare, till they become victorious over all. The phraſe of the <hi>Feet</hi> is ſometimes othe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſed and applyed as to, 1. <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillage,</hi> as the Saints to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.33. and <hi>Paul</hi> at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> Acts 22.3. 2. <hi>Subjection,</hi> Pſalm. 8.6. <hi>As the Creatures are put under our feet.</hi> 3. <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as of ſervants, <hi>John</hi> 13.14. and of ſervile condition. 4. <hi>Weak</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible means; <hi>Iſa</hi> 2.66. <hi>The feet of the poor ſhall tread down the high and lofty
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:173117:87"/>ones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being juſt and upright perſons:</hi> But in theſe the phraſe it is not ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this Text, as the former three figurative ſenſes, though otherwiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Shod,</hi> this is done corporally, when ſhooes are put upon the feet, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.6. Or ſpiritually, when the affections of the heart are ſtrengthned with the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, (as in the Text) to go through all difficulties in their way to Heaven, which are many and ſharp. <hi>Can.</hi> 7.1. How, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (i.e.) her walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in holineſs, her Ornament, defence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>With the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> (i.e.) with a due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and readineſs <hi>tum ad confeſsionem, &amp; ad praedicationem Evangelii.</hi> 1. <hi>Being ever ready to confeſs the Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.10. <hi>with the mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the hope that is in us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. <hi>with meekneſs and fear.</hi> 2. <hi>And to preach the Goſpel when lawfully called thereunto,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. Rom. 10.14.15.</p>
            <p>You know that the whole courſe of our lives is often compared to a Way,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173117:88"/>Walk or Journey, and alſo to a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: and for either of theſe men do make ſuch proviſion and preparation as is neceſſary, and ſo we muſt do here as the Text here teacheth us, the point is, That,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>We (who are Chriſtian Soldiers) muſt make diligent preparation to profeſs and practiſe the Goſpel, and alſo to preach and publiſh the ſame, as we ſhall be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ This point doth conſiſt of two branches: The firſt of which concerns all, and the ſecond concerns only the Preachers of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We ſhall take them a ſunder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that which is univerſally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for all Chriſtians, <hi>viz. To profeſs and practiſe the Goſpel of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exp.</hi> The Goſpel is ſo called, (<hi>q.d.</hi>) a <hi>Goodſpel,</hi> or <hi>Gods-Spell,</hi> viz. <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.6, 7. and 3.8. which was preached unto <hi>Abraham</hi> long ſince, and it doth contain: 1. The Hiſtory and Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the things which Chriſt ſpake and did, which are of excellent uſe for our Inſtruction, Imitation and Conſolation,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173117:88"/>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1. 2. The whole Doctrine of the Word, both of Law and Grace, and whole matter of inſtruction to rule to guide us under Chriſt, <hi>Who,</hi> Mark 1.14. <hi>Came preaching the Goſpel of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> And thus we ſtand bound and hear, believe, profeſs and practiſe the ſame. 3. <hi>The glad tidings of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins and eternal ſalvation, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Free grace, and obtaining righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by faith, and teaching the true way, how to attain perfect Righteouſneſs and Eternal Life;</hi> This was manifeſted of old in referrence to Chriſt to come, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12. In the Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. To us, in reſpect to Chriſt already come, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. Rom. 11.27, 18. <hi>This is my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> they are enemies for your ſakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Goſpel</hi> we are commanded fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to hear and believe, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.57. To yield obedience to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 16. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. And to walk uprightly according to the truth of it. This is ſtyled, 1. <hi>Glorious,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. 1 Tim. 1.1. 2. <hi>The power of God
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173117:89"/>to Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16. 3. <hi>Childrens bread,</hi> Mat. 15 26. <hi>Milk for babes,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.2. 4. <hi>The word of Gods grace,</hi> Acts 14.2. 5. <hi>The word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8. 6. <hi>The Savour of his knowledge,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.14, 15, 16. 7. <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3, 8. <hi>and of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. 8. <hi>The Word of Truth,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. 9. <hi>Of life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. 10. <hi>The Doctrine which is according to godlineſs.</hi> 11. <hi>The form of ſound words,</hi> 2.

            <p>Reaſons which may be added to theſe honourable appellations of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> are <hi>becauſe by this we are begotten to</hi> God, 1 Cor. 4 15. <hi>And in it we have our legacy of peace and ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 52.7. <hi>and of all things conducible thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This requires Faith, Love, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Self-denial, Crucifying the fleſh, a new Creature, the putting off the old man, and putting on the new man.</p>
            <p>Thus we have heard what the Goſpel is, <hi>viz.</hi> it is good tidings: and what it doth contain. How we ought to hear, believe and obey it, walking uprightly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173117:89"/>according to the truth of it; and that from divers motives wrapt up in the manifold Honourable Appellations wherewith God hath crowned it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our great benefit by it: and theſe do induce the main Reaſons by which we are induced hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And likewiſe we have heard what it doth require of us that we may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Concerning all the particulars which it doth require; <hi>It doth concern us to enquire, whether our ſelves or our Converſation be as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, walking worthy of the Lord, who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, and alſo unto his Kingdom and Glory, and of our heavenly Vocation wherewith we are called,</hi> Epheſ. 4.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> If we walk regularly anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any one of theſe, then we are rightly ſaid, <hi>To walk worthy of them all;</hi> or elſe we walk worthy of none of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To walk as it becometh the Goſpel,</hi> is to lead a life agreeable to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and that becauſe, 1. The

               <hi>Goſpel</hi> may not be evil ſpoken of through us, <hi>young women muſt be ſo qualified, that the word of God be not blaſphemed,</hi> Titus 2.5. So alſo Propfeſſors and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of others muſt take heed of breaking the Law, <hi>leſt the name of God be blaſphemed through us,</hi> Rom. 2.17. as thoſe Captives of <hi>Iſrael</hi> profaned the name of the Lord among the Heathen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36: 19: 2. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> may be adorned by them in all things, as thoſe good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.9, 10. And thoſe whom the Apoſtle ſo exhorteth. 3. And that we may be exemplary to others, and inſtruments of their Converſion.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>To walk worthy of the Lord,</hi> is in a conformity to his Image; our relations to him, as of a good Wife to ſo worthy a husband, dutiful Children to ſo good a Father, loyal Subjects to ſuch a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent

               <hi>Ap.</hi> Every of which doth conclude us in all the Duties of each Relation; and doth diſcover unto us the Iniquity, Folly and Miſery of all ſuch who do deſert this husband for any other, or diſobey ſo good and tender a Father, or rebel againſt, and revolt from this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Potentate, and do become voluntary Subjects to the prince of darkneſs; you will all ſay, <hi>This is a bad change,</hi> yet how many are guilty of all theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions referring to each relation, and do make this change uſually.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>To walk worthy of the holy and heavenly Vocation</hi> (which Chriſt hath given us by the Goſpel) <hi>wherewith we are called by Chriſt in the Goſpel,</hi> and by which we receive the Spirit, <hi>whereby we are ſealed to the day of Redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30.</p>
            <p>This Vocation or Calling is holy and heavenly, becauſe it is a voice deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from heaven, infuſing heaven into us here, and inducting us into heaven at
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173117:91"/>the laſt, all which it doth effect by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to Holineſs, which it begetteth and cheriſheth in us here, and crowneth with perfection for ever in Heaven.</p>
            <p>This Vocation is either external by the Preachers, or internal by the Spirit, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.10. Both are the fruit of Gods Free Grace, and of his love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>And this holy Calling teacheth us how to walk worthy of the Lord, and this Vocation it ſelf, and the Goſpel by which we are ſo called: and they do walk worthy of all theſe, who walk in the ſight of Gods preſence, and in a lively ſenſe of the ſame, do make an holy progreſs in the ways of God from ſtrength to ſtrength; that walk ſuitably with the nature of God, and example of Chriſt by rule, in integrity, with conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as <hi>Zachariah</hi> &amp; <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luk. 1.5, 6. In the light whiles they have it, wiſely and honeſtly toward them that be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, neither giving nor learning any evil example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But (alas for Grief) how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do not only forget, and vary from,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173117:91"/>but do walk quite contrary to all the forenamed particulars.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now deſcend to the Uſes and improvement of all theſe: and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this piece of Armour being as broad as the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Peace by the knowledge and practiſe of which we are thus ſhod and prepared to walk on, and go forward in our ſpiritual jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney heaven-ward; as alſo to war and march on in this <hi>ſpiritual</hi> warfare with the more confidence and comfort in hope of victory over ſuch potent and prevalent enemies; I ſay the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> being uſeful to both theſe ends, the Uſes would be exceeding large, and the improvement of theſe ſhooes might be as long laſting as the ſhooes, and other Apparrel of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was in their journey from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was forty years, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But this hath been my work ſo long already in my publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to teach men to be thus ſhod and prepared; and I truſt both you and I ſhall make it the work of our whole lives, and be ſo ſhod and prepared by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:173117:92"/>the Goſpel of Chriſt, that we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably finiſh our Walk, and our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare heaven-ward, and at laſt get home, and enter into an everlaſting peace: therefore I ſhall not hoiſe Sails in ſo vaſt an Ocean, nor undertake the diſcovery of ſo large a Continent in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this particular: This being the drift of the whole Goſpel, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of the longeſt life.</p>
            <p>☞ I ſhall only give you a few keys, with which you may open doors, and enter into certain gardens, or fields of meditation, where you may take a view of your ſouls from time to time, and may there ſee:</p>
            <p n="1">1. How the good fruits (corn or ſeeds) do proſper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And how the weeds (tares or bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) do encreaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And ſo apply your ſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for the cheriſhing of the one, or the checking of the other. Is it ſo then</p>
            <p>That we (Chriſtian Souldiers) muſt make diligent preparation. 1. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practiſe the Goſpel: And 2. To preach and publiſh it, when lawfully
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173117:92"/>called thereunto. Then the Uſes of all ſorts fall under theſe keys or heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. How few are their wills and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which (as the Feet) are the beginners of motion and action thus <hi>ſhod, (i. e.)</hi> thus furniſhed, fenced and ſtrengthned with the Goſpel of Chriſt, to march and paſs on in their way to heaven through all difficulties and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Hence it is (viz. through the want hereof) that ſo many ſtumble and ſlide, and fall from the right both in opinion and practiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How few do hear, believe, and obey the Goſpel, as we ſhould, which we are ſo often commanded to do, or do care to know, and be well acquainted with it, but do wilfully remain ignorant, although we ſhould be therein, as it is ſaid of <hi>Apollos, That he was a man mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> Acts 18.24.</p>
            <p>To each of theſe keys or heads, you may ſubjoyn Uſes of Information, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Reproof or Comfort, as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How few do prize the Goſpel, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:173117:93"/>value it according to its names and Analogies, our Legacy contained in it, our new birth effected by it. Children ſhould honour their Parents, by whom (as Inſtruments) they have a <hi>natural being,</hi> a <hi>temporal proviſion,</hi> and <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Legacies</hi> ſuitable with the Parents Ability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> How much more ſhould we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our <hi>Spiritual Parents,</hi> and regard our new birth, and ſpiritual being which is effected by the immortal and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed of the World of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. And value our <hi>Legacies</hi> of Grace and glory contained in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How little <hi>Faith, Love, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Self-denial, Mortification</hi> and <hi>Renovation</hi> can be found in moſt men?</p>
            <p n="5">5. How few do live as becomes the Goſpel! honour it and adorn it, and ſhine according to it, but do rather cauſe it to be evil ſpoken of, and ſhame the profeſſion of it by the deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by the works of the world, the fleſh and the devil; do give evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others, and alienate them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173117:93"/>from walking according to the <hi>truth of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. How few do <hi>walk worthy of the Lord,</hi> either in the imitation of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or in anſwering our many and near Relations to him, as a <hi>good Wife, Children, Servants, Subjects,</hi> a people (like Iſrael) <hi>redeemed and ſaved by the Lord, who is the only Refuge, Shield of help,</hi> &amp;c. And ſhould we not anſwer theſe things with duty?</p>
            <p n="7">7. How <hi>few do walk worthy of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavenly Vocation,</hi> according to the forenamed marks, <hi>i. e. As in the ſight of God, making an holy progreſs, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with the nature of God,</hi> and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, by Rule with integrity and Conſtancy in and according to the Light, wiſely and honeſtly toward them that be without.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But inſtead of <hi>walking</hi> thus, how many do not only <hi>forget,</hi> and <hi>vary much from,</hi> but do <hi>walk</hi> quite contrary to all the forenamed particulars.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And laſtly, <hi>How irregular</hi> (in general) <hi>is mens practiſe to the rule of the Goſpel,</hi> with which we ſhould be thus
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:173117:94"/>ſhod and prepared: 1. <hi>Rulers</hi> inverting Authority to wrong ends. 2. <hi>Soldiers</hi> exceeding their <hi>limits,</hi> Luke 3.14. 3. All <hi>people of all ſorts, ranks and qualities</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bounds and tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the directions of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> In conſideration of all which, we may well complain and ſay, <hi>What a bare-foot world do we live in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ <hi>All theſe keys do open doors,</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundant matter for <hi>Information, Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Conſolation</hi> to all thoſe that are ſo ſhod, and do thus <hi>walk</hi> as you have been taught, <hi>For they ſhall be ſure to ſhare in all Legacies, Comforts, Promiſes and Performances of the</hi> Goſpel, <hi>which are innumerable, invaluable, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all our thoughts,</hi> Epheſ. 3.20.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the firſt branch of this Doctrine, <hi>viz. That we who are Chriſtian Soldiers, muſt make diligent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to profeſs and practiſe the</hi> Goſpel <hi>of peace;</hi> I do now deſcend to the ſecond branch of it, which only concerns <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That ſome of us Chriſtian Soldiers muſt make a like diligent preparation to</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:173117:94"/>preach <hi>and Publiſh the</hi> Goſpel <hi>of Chriſt when we are lawfully called thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This I think no man makes doubt of, <hi>but that there muſt be ſome Preachers of the</hi> Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that this <hi>ſome, or number of Preachers,</hi> muſt themſelves be <hi>Chriſtian Soldiers,</hi> (yea as Commanders and Leaders in an Army) <hi>to march with, and before others in this ſpiritual Warfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And that they muſt make a diligent preparation <hi>to become Preachers,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Give attendance to reading,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And that they muſt enter upon this Work of <hi>Preaching</hi> when they are lawfully called thereunto. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelf, but he that is called of</hi> God, <hi>as was</hi> Aaron, (i.e.) No man elſe ought to take it, but he that is called.</p>
            <p>☞ And this <hi>Calling</hi> is conjoyn'd with as warrantable a ſending, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> i.e. <hi>lawfully ordained thereunto,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid or ſpake to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. where you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173117:95"/>have a very formal (yea the true ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal form of) <hi>Ordination of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to their Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Sending</hi> muſt go together, and Miniſters muſt be called, and alſo ſent, i. e. <hi>Called by the neceſsity of the Church, which is the call of</hi> God, and ſent by Epiſcopal men, Elders and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of the Churches, <hi>the lawful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Chriſt and his Apostles,</hi> who are beſt able to judge of the Abilities, Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Qualifications of ſuch as are to be the Miniſters and Paſtors of the Churches.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> or a <hi>Viſitation-Sermon,</hi> I do not think needful or ſo uſeful for you, as ſome other advice: And I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no adviſed, diſcreet perſon amongſt you, that doth conſider the great and weighty charge impoſed upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Preachers of Gods Word, both in the Old and New Teſtament. The Names, Titles, and honourable compariſons beſtowed upon them in Scripture, to the number of an hundred and upwards; all importing the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:173117:95"/>of them, as of <hi>Light, Salt, Pillars</hi> for the <hi>Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Seers</hi> to be <hi>Guides to lead the blind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vigilancy, Induſtry, Pains, Labor</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> which muſt be undergone by them, as of <hi>Watchmen, Husbandmen,</hi> as well as the <hi>Dignity</hi> due to them <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably</hi> to their work. I ſay you that do conſider this, cannot but be convinced of the <hi>great preparation,</hi> that a <hi>Miniſter</hi> had need to have to undergo, perform and diſcharge <hi>ſuch a function</hi> well as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>But my work and aim is, according to the duty of my place, and what this <hi>Text</hi> doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> injoyn me to do, is, <hi>in this uſurping age, to give you a ſtay to prevent you from being miſled,</hi> by giving you a little <hi>light</hi> into this now uſual Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether every gifted brother, (or ſiſter, as ſome ſay) that is able to, may not take upon him the paſtoral Function or Office of a Miniſter to the full, and in all things?</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Taking the ſhield or Buckler,</hi> you may note, <hi>that theſe two words are promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly and indifferently uſed one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> for the <hi>ſubſtance, ſhape, Dimenſions,</hi> and uſe of them with <hi>horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot, I</hi> might acquaint you out of <hi>Polysbius, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and other Authors, <hi>vid.</hi> Mat.

            <p>Theſe things premiſed, and the Text thus explained, it doth afford us,</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Apply theſe to every dart.</p>
            <p>Uſe I. The firſt Uſe of Reproof is to <hi>Unbelievers</hi> who want this Shield: theſe either know not, or acknowledge not, or apply not the word, nor conform to it: Many are guilty of this, and this is a grievous ſin: for it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hinders the Word of God, and works of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 4.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Defiles all in us and to us, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Makes that we cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But depart from God. <hi>Infidelity</hi> is the ground and fountain of all diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:173117:106"/>bedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And perſecute his ſervants, as <hi>Acts</hi> 14.2. the <hi>Jews</hi> did.</p>
            <p>God taxeth it in the <hi>Jews</hi> that believed not his Word, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.24. Chriſt upbraideth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. And as the <hi>Jews</hi> entred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, ſo God will puniſh it with his abſence, and with torments, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eve,</hi> and the old World, <hi>Lots</hi> ſons, <hi>Egyptians, Iſraelites,</hi> were all undone by it.</p>
            <p>☞ If we were but almoſt perſwaded, as (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.28.) he to be Chriſtian; and did we thereupon cry as he, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Help mine unbelief,</hi> there were hope of us, that we might become Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but whilſt the Thief and three thouſand were ſo ſoon converted, we do ſtill remain in unbelief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gutta cavat lapidem, vel vi, vel ſaepe cadendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But neither force nor frequency of the Word prevail with us: and hardneſs of heart through unbelief will bring deſtruction.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:173117:106"/>
            <p>Thus you know who are Unbelievers, what Unbelief is, how hainous a ſin it is in the fruits and effects thereof, and how dreadful in the end and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Uſe doth alſo reprove all preſumptuous perſons, that think they have a Buckler, when all proves to be but a <hi>ſhield</hi> of painted paper, or fig leaf, which can do us no good in a ſtorm of Temptation, no more than <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> clothing of fig-leaves could ſhelter them from the injury of a cold Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. And here likewiſe we are to conſider, What it is, whence it ſprings, how ſinful it is, the fruits of it, and the end of it.</p>
            <p>I do now proceed to the laſt piece of the <hi>defenſive Armour,</hi> which is the fifth in order, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Helmet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exp.</hi> The words are few and plain, only obſerve that an <hi>Helmet</hi> is a piece of Armour fitted for the defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the head, which we commonly call an <hi>Head-piece.</hi> Now a Helmet or Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of Armour is either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Artificial,</hi> wrought by the hands
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:173117:107"/>ſome skilfulful Work-man, and fitted for the heads defence: They were made antiently of Braſs or Copper, ſince of ſteel and iron, and that for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſoundneſs and durableneſs of the mettal, <hi>Aes enimeſt maxime durabile,</hi> it will abide blows without yieldance: and with ſuch do ſoldiers uſe to arm their heads, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did, and <hi>David</hi> aſſaied, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.5, 38.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and this is the Helmet in the Text, and this is aſcribed to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by the Prophet: <hi>He put on Righteouſneſs as a Breaſt-plate, and an</hi> Helmet <hi>of Salvation upon his head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.7. Though theſe things are to be underſtood far otherwiſe of God, then of us, (though the Apoſtle here doth allude unto theſe terms) for the Prophet there doth deſcribe God as a man of Arms, putting on his Armour, and fitting himſelf for the performance of ſome notable Exploits, and great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments; and the meaning is, <hi>That God doth undertake the care of his peoples Warfare, in their deliverance from miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, temporal and eternal, and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:173117:107"/>and deſtruction of their enemies, that his power, juſtice, regard of his own glory, and tender affection to his people, ſhall as evidently appear and be ſeen, as goodly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gliſtring armour upon the body of one that weareth it,</hi> Pſalm 93.1. and 94.1, 2. and 98.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And have we no experience of this in our deliverances from the <hi>Rump, Lambert,</hi> and Sectarian party, and Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Government.</p>
            <p>But as this Text is applyable to us, ſo this <hi>Helmet</hi> doth point and direct us to ſome particular grace ſingularly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us in our Way and War to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>and this grace is hope of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.8.</p>
            <p>☞ And this hope of ſalvation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, by whoſe merits we are ſaved, and may lift up our ſelves (heads) as being already victorious in the combate which we are to fight, is as an Helmet of defence and glory to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And in this ſenſe <hi>Hope</hi> is ſtiled the <hi>Helmet of ſalvation,</hi> both here in the Text, and alſo in that place, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:173117:108"/>and thus you have the meaning of the words, which being thus underſtood, gives us this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Chriſtians hope is to him an helmet of Salvation:</hi> ſo that as a Soldier doth arm his head with an helmet againſt <hi>cuts</hi> and <hi>knocks,</hi> and other hurts which it may elſe meet with; ſo doth a true Chriſtian arm and fence his heart and mind (the principal Eſſential part of man) againſt the manifold (<hi>furibundos inſultus Diaboli piſcator</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.7.) furious aſſaults of the devil. This <hi>hope</hi> we muſt take up, and make uſe of in this Warfare.</p>
            <p>☞ Now concerning this Grace of hope, ſomething muſt be ſpokon for Explication, Confirmation, and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the point.</p>
            <p>Now, 1. for <hi>Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Defin. <hi>Spes eſt extenſio appetitus in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petibile,</hi> Aquin. Hope is an extenſion or inlarging of the deſire after ſomething deſireable; thus ſay the Schoolmen: This reacheth hope in the general, and this <hi>hope</hi> is varied, and may be either good or bad according to the nature of the appetite, and object of the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:173117:108"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Divines</hi> come nearer, and ſays as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Hope is a deſire after ſomething which we do believe we may attain to, or of ſome excellent good thing</hi> (cum fiducia obtinendi) <hi>with confidence of obtaining it:</hi> and this Object of our Hope is attended with four conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> That it muſt be, 1. <hi>Bonum.</hi> 2. <hi>Arduum.</hi> 3. <hi>Futurum.</hi> 4. <hi>Poſsibile.</hi> 1. Good. 2. Hard to be gotten. 3. Future, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. 4. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be attained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So that a Chriſtians Hope is a confident expectation of all good hings promiſed to us both concerning this life, and a better in heavenly glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But we rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>of the felicity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which they ſhall have in the preſence of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. though at preſent they ſuffer, and others deride their Exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>Our hope in God for Salvation and future bleſſedneſs,</hi> is a Grace infuſed into our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, by which we expect all future good things, grace and glory, (<hi>&amp; mitigationem preſentis
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:173117:109"/>crucis, &amp; liberationem,</hi> as alſo the miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and deliverance from preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and afflictions according to the good counſel and will of God, reſting upon the promiſes of God, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt apprehended by faith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40, 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 52.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 130.5, 6, 7, 8. I have waited, and do wait, and yet will ſtill wait for the Lord, more then they that waited for the morning; yea and let all Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with him is mercy and plenteous <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, And he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and calamities,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13. <hi>yea hope to end,</hi> for the grace to be brought at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Hopes</hi> eyes are upon God the donor and giver. Our ſalvation, (the <hi>ultimus finis</hi>) the laſt and beſt gift to us. Upon the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereto, as the <hi>Auxilia gratiae,</hi> the manifold graces by which we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſalvation and bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>You have heard the <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> what this Hope is, and the definitions of the ſame both general and ſpecial, now for the cauſes of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The principal efficient cauſe is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:173117:109"/>God, who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. He of his abundant Mercy hath begotten us unto a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; to an inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inſtrumental cauſe is Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. For hope ſprings from faith, as a branch from the root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> For becauſe we believe in him, therefore we hope for all good from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The impulſive or moving cauſe of our Hope is, the manifold goodneſs and free benefits of God to his people, and the former favours to them, and to our ſelves, of which we have had ſo great experience.</p>
            <p>He that hath formerly drank at a plentiful ſpring, will ſtill hope to ſpeed well there, when he hath occaſion and ſtands in need of ſupply of water, and ſo may we here for ſupport and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The final cauſe or end of our Hope. 1. The <hi>Glory</hi> of God, in whom we place our hope, that muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:173117:110"/>by us, and exalted for his mercy and grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18, 19.2. Our own ſalvation and bleſſedneſs, for which we hope and wait upon him, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Iſa. 30.18, 19. 1 Theſ. 5.8. and thus for the cauſes of hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Subject of it is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and only ſuch as are ſo: it is <hi>ſpes piorum,</hi> the hope of the godly, not of the wicked, living <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> dead, Rev. 6.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſeat of it is the heart, which is <hi>ſedes Affectum,</hi> the ſeat of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not ſo much of the ſenſitive, as of the intellective part: of the Will eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which is ſometimes called <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitus mentis,</hi> the ſouls appetite, <hi>Pol. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag.</hi> 598.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The place of it is moſt properly, <hi>&amp; ſimpliciter,</hi> the earth, and thoſe that are living both in ſoul and body in this world, who hope for many things in <hi>heaven,</hi> there is only the hope of reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body to immortal glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then there it will ceaſe, and the compleating of all divine promiſes to the Church and people of God, as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173117:110"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. then it ceaſeth. In hell there can be no hope of <hi>any good to all eternity,</hi> to thoſe damned ſouls chain'd and bound up to everlaſtling miſery.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Object of it is firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the <hi>Lord,</hi> Pſalm 33.22. and 38.13. <hi>As we hope in him, ſo we expect mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from him.</hi> His <hi>Mercy, Pſalm</hi> 33.18. <hi>and</hi> 147.11. <hi>Gods eye and pleaſure is on ſuch as hope ſo.</hi> His <hi>Word, Pſalm</hi> 119.81. and 38.15. Elſe <hi>David</hi> had fainted. And <hi>Jeſus Chriſt his ſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. If in this life, and then in ſubſerven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>All the benefits of God promiſed to us, and particularly <hi>Beneficia, Veniae, Gratiae, Gloriae,</hi> of <hi>pardon of all our ſins for the merits ſake of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.1, 2. <hi>being freed from the miniſtration of death by the Law.</hi> Grace, and all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſpiritual and corporal uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon men in that ſtate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.3.11. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. <hi>wait for it,</hi> (though it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) <hi>etiamſi ſupra natura eſſent,</hi> Rom. 4.18. <hi>Glory in a joyful reſurrection, and in the ſtate of glory,</hi> Acts 2.26, 27, 28. and 23.6. and 24.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:173117:111"/>
            <p n="7">7. The Adjuncts of it are. 1. <hi>A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> of Mind, 1 Pet. 1.13. 1 John 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himſelf.</hi> 2. A holy Life. 3. Perſeverance to the end, till the revelation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it ſhall ceaſe. 4. Aſſurance, and this ariſeth from, and is <hi>grounded</hi> upon the <hi>truth of Gods promiſes,</hi> the <hi>merits of Chriſt,</hi> the effectual omnipotence of God that promiſeth good, <hi>to perform whatſoever he hath promiſed,</hi> whereas mens <hi>promiſes, merits,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of performance is as nothing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>effects</hi> of Hope are many, for it makes men,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The more godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To think <hi>(humiliter)</hi> lowly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and <hi>ſublimiter,</hi> highly of God, upon whom <hi>the hopeful man doth wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To renounce our own merits,</hi> and to reſt only upon free grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Aſſurance of future good by the mercy of God, and merits of Chriſt only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Perſeverance in our duty to God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Patience and joy in Afflictions,</hi> Rom. 12.2.</p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:173117:111"/>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>In quibus conveniunt &amp; differunt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des &amp; ſpes,</hi> the agreement and difference betwixt Faith and hope.</p>
            <p>Now concerning this <hi>ninth particularr,</hi> conſider, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Saving faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> do agree in the common efficient cauſe of them both, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> for it is he that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both into our hearts, adjoyning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance, for each of them gives us the like aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the difference between them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Faith begetteth Hope, and ſo is before it; but hope comes after, and is an individual companion of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> is perſwaded that God ſpake truth: hope waits the occaſion of time when God will diſcover it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> is perſwaded of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God, who can neither lye nor deceive,</hi> &amp;c. and of all his Promiſes, hope expects pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the performance of them, and that God will effect them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith</hi> believes that God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hope expects that he will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent himſelf to us accordingly.</p>
            <p n="5">5: <hi>Faith</hi> repreſents future things as preſent Hope waits for. Then</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:173117:112"/>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Faith</hi> believes that Eternal Life is given us, Hope waits till it come, and be revealed to us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Faith</hi> is the foundation, and Hope reſteth upon it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Faith</hi> ſuſtains feeds, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes Hope: for we cannot hope to have any thing from God, except we believe his <hi>Promiſes;</hi> and Hope by patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtrengthens the weakneſs of our Faith, if that fail not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>The Oppoſites are Doubt, Deſpair, hope</hi> in the <hi>Creature,</hi> and <hi>humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and all the vain <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> men in, and for <hi>evil things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the , 1. Definitions. 2. Cauſes. 3. Subject. 4. Seat. 5. Place. 6. Object. 7. Adjuncts. 8. Effects. 9. The difference betwixt Faith and Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 10. Oppoſites of this Grace of hope, <hi>the helmet of ſalvation.</hi>

            <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the explication of the point.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now I deſcend to the ſecond parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular propounded, <hi>viz. The confirmation of the point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. It is frequently commanded in

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doubtful perſons,</hi> that fear God will not defend, nor deliver them in time of temptation, nor beſtow eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life upon them: True it is, that in us there is cauſe enough to doubt, when we conſider our ſins; but let us bewail this, and our Confidence may be in God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſpairful people,</hi> that apprehend their ſins to be greater than mercy can pardon: <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. Thus did <hi>Cain;</hi> ſo thoſe that had no <hi>hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. This is a great ſin: Of this ſee my Notes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thoſe that hope in the creature,</hi> as too many do.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:173117:114"/>and after <hi>evil things:</hi> We are here in a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> a <hi>Maze,</hi> an <hi>inextricable way:</hi> It were endleſs to ſpeak of the <hi>vanity of mens hopes:</hi> Take but a few Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Balaam</hi> (no doubt) hoped to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and advance himſelf</hi> by the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> according to <hi>Balacks</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.17.2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. but it proved otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And bloody <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> by the ſlaughter of his Brethren, made himſelf a <hi>King;</hi> but you know what his <hi>End</hi> was, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ahab</hi> hoped to compaſs <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard to enlarge his Homeſtal, and to hold it alſo when he had gotten it, he did ſo, but he had and held it with a vengeance, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Zimri</hi> (no doubt) when he had ſlain his Mr. <hi>Elah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and reigned in his ſtead, hoped he had been ſafe enough, but <hi>Omri</hi> brought him to a deſparate end, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.9, 10, 16, to 21. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.31. <hi>Had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> All thoſe <hi>hopes</hi> vaniſh and periſh, and no marvel, for God hath ſpoken it, <hi>The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, and,</hi> Job 8.13, 14, 15. <hi>be as a Spiders web; his houſe ſhall not ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but be as a dying man giving up the Ghoſt,</hi> Job 11.20.

            <p>Queſt. So that we may ask the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173117:115"/>(as <hi>Job.</hi> 27.8.) <hi>What is the Hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though he had gained, when God takes away his ſoul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sure when death comes, <hi>The hope of unjuſt men periſheth,</hi> Prov. 11.7, 23. <hi>and ends in wrath.</hi> Pſalm 112.10. <hi>The wicked ſhall ſee, and grieve, and periſh, and melt away; the deſire</hi> (or Hope) <hi>of the wicked ſhall periſh.</hi> Such hopes are like duſt or chaff, fome or thin froth, ſmoak that is ſoon diſperſed, or a Gueſt that ſtays but a day, ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.14. Or like an <hi>unfaithful man</hi> in time of <hi>Trouble, a broken tooth, and a foot out of joynt;</hi> Prov. 25.19. ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Should I bring theſe things down to our times, when ſhould I end, and conclude this Subject! For how many did hope, that upon the death of the late King, both <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing, King</hi> and <hi>King-ſhip</hi> hath been dead for ever; and that either <hi>Anarchy</hi> or <hi>Tyranny, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy</hi> or <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rump,</hi> ſhould have domineered over us for ever! And that <hi>King, Kingdom, Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Free Parliament</hi> conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſhould never have appeared more!
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173117:116"/>Others had better hopes, and now God hath decided the <hi>buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know the point from this <hi>helmet of ſalvation,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>A Chriſtians hope of ſalvation is to him an helmet, which he muſt take, and make uſe in this ſpiritual Warfare:</hi> This hath been explicated, confirmed, and applyed in part. The firſt Uſe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>deſpairful perſons.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Thoſe that hope in the Creature, in humane inventions, or in their own Merits.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>The vain hopes of evil men, in, and after vain or evil things.</hi> Inſtances of which are innumerable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Balaam.</hi> 2. <hi>Abimeleck.</hi> 3. <hi>Ahab.</hi> 4. <hi>Zimri.</hi> 5. <hi>Athaliah.</hi> 6. <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> 7. <hi>Iſrael hoping in Egypt.</hi> 8. <hi>Thoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters with death and hell.</hi> And, 9. <hi>Thoſe Husbandmen in the Goſpel,</hi> who ſlew the Heir, and did ſeize upon his inheritance, hoping they had much advantaged themſelves thereby, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. whereas indeed they utterly undid themſelves by ſo doing, as it is evident to this day, (1600. years ſince.)</p>
            <p>Theſe nine Inſtances were propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173117:116"/>unto you, with a brief <hi>Application</hi> to theſe times, and expreſſion of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgements of God againſt ſuch <hi>ſinful and ungodly hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I have proceeded: I do now deſcend to the Uſes of <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which you may conjoyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for brevity ſake.</p>
            <p>The ſecond and third Uſe of <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> is <hi>A Chriſtians hope of ſalvation,</hi> a <hi>helmet;</hi> then try, and examine your ſelves what Uſe you make of it. You have heard it opened in the Cauſes and Effects of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Now do you <hi>importune</hi> God much for this Grace of Hope, <hi>he is the Donor of this, and every perfect gift;</hi> He is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all good, and to him we muſt have recourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How do we cheriſh <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> cauſe of this. <hi>Faith</hi> is a principal grace, as you have heard: Then uſe all means to ſtrengthen it, and ſtarve it not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth our <hi>hope of ſalvation</hi> make us act the more ſtrenuouſly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly: For the, 1. <hi>Glory of God,</hi> from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:173117:117"/>whom we expect <hi>ſalvation,</hi> according to what we pray for, (<hi>Orat. Dom. Pet.</hi> 1.) <hi>hollowed be thy Name; Glorifie him in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> How can we hope for ſuch honour from him, whom we wilfully diſhonour daily! Be you exhorted and perſwaded to mend what is amiſs in this particular. 2. And for our own <hi>Salvation</hi> in the way of it, and in the purſuit of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may further the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe are the final cauſes and ends of your hope; do you anſwer them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hope,</hi> it is <hi>Spes piorum,</hi> and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated only to the godly; See that you be ſuch, theſe are the proper Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles fit for ſuch Wine: <hi>The wicked have no hope, being without God in the world,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. 1 Theſ. 4.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What are the Objects of our <hi>hope?</hi> Is our <hi>hope</hi> fixed upon God, Chriſt, his Word, and his Mercy, Goodneſs, and the manifold benefits <hi>(Veniae, Gratiae, Gloriae)</hi> of <hi>Pardon, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> the fruits of his Mercy, and the ſtreams of that fountain of <hi>living water:</hi> For the <hi>Mercies of God fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:173117:117"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Do we eſteem the fruition of theſe the greateſt Bleſſings: or is our <hi>hope</hi> ſet upon the world, the <hi>pleaſures, profits,</hi> and <hi>preferments</hi> of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Senſual,</hi> and <hi>ſinful pleaſures</hi> are as much as ſome (<hi>Epicuri de grege porci,</hi> Epicures and others do hope for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With others; <hi>Gold is their hope, and gain their godlineſs.</hi> Job 31.24. He did not ſo: And <hi>Mammon</hi> their God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the <hi>Glory, Pomp</hi> and <hi>Preferment</hi> of this world, have cauſed many to fall down, and worſhip the God of this world: This our Saviour refuſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How are our minds prepared, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. and our lives purified, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.1. To entertain ſuch a perſeverance, as is required of us, <hi>viz To hold faſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and rejoycing of hope firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt unto the end,</hi> Heb. 3.6, 14. And, 2. Such a full aſſurance of Hope unto the end, as is expected and deſired by us, Heb. 6.11. which muſt be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diligence, Faith and Patience, not ſlothfulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> We muſt be at pains to reach this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:173117:118"/>Aſſurance, and great diligence muſt be uſed to keep it free and full, without anxiety and doubting: Let this be your work.</p>
            <p n="7">7. What effects have this our <hi>hope of ſalvation</hi> wrought and produced in us? Are we hereby taught to be more <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded? Are our hearts there where our hopes are?</hi> And are we more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to <hi>heavenly conditions</hi> and <hi>qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> there is <hi>perfect Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Love</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> all in agreement, and one <hi>God, and Father over all, who is infinitely good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But we on earth have had many Maſters, none of the beſt; and amongſt our ſelves, are full of Fractions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. <hi>Machiavels</hi> wicked rule hath had great power, influence and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with us for many years, <hi>viz. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide &amp; impera,</hi> which hath been migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily acted by a <hi>Jeſuited party, Divide and Rule.</hi> We have more reſembled a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>Bears,</hi> and <hi>Lions, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tigers,</hi> rather then a Paradiſe of God, a place of peace, where the Lion and the Lamb lye down in peace together,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:173117:118"/>
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. to 10. and 65.25. We have broken one anothers heads, and hands, and hearts, and Eſtates; and how all things have ſuited with this Helmet of Salvation, I leave to wiſe, experienced Chriſtians to determine, <hi>Tantaene animis coelestibus Irae?</hi> Great anger among heavenly minds, was ſtrange to Heathens; The good Lord mend it now among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How much more humble are we then formerly; This is a <hi>valley of grace, Capſula virtutum,</hi> a Cabinet of vertues; the firſt ſtep to heaven; to which God gives his grace, and then adds Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Yet how few have, and embrace this?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How much <hi>Self-denial,</hi> all in reference to the things of this world, hath this <hi>hope</hi> wrought in us: Who denys himſelf the more, in reſpect of diſhoneſt gain: Or willingly reſtores things unlawfully gotten. We hope for heaven, yet we would willingly hold the worſt gotten goods on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> How theſe things ſuit, I know not.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:173117:119"/>
            <p n="4">4. What <hi>Patience</hi> upon earth in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Afflictions and Injuries? Hath our hope of heaven wrought in us?</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, What <hi>perſeverance</hi> in the performance of our duty to God and man; Have we been more ſerviceable to God, and more profitable, uſeful and beneficial to men then formerly? hath our hope of heaven enlivened our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God, and <hi>enlarged</hi> our good affections, our <hi>hearts</hi> and our <hi>hands in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to men?</hi> Or rather, have not we been like thoſe deſperate people, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 13.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 18.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee the places) who when the Prophet had reproved them for their ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They anſwered him croſly and negatively, yea deſperately; for they ſaid, <hi>Noaſh deſperatum eſt,</hi> (a deſperate word) <hi>q.d. the caſe is deſperate, and we are at a point, there is no remedy, we are past cure, paſt care, and therefore we will do as we have done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We have loved strangers and ſtrange courſes, and ſo we will do ſtill;</hi> a prophane reſolution.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what was their courſe and crime?</hi> I anſwer with the Prophet.</p>
            <pb n="221" facs="tcp:173117:119"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They committed two great Evils, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And perſiſted in evil till their own wickedneſs corrected them,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
            <p>They were, 1. <hi>like a degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine,</hi> verſ. 21.</p>
            <p>Or, 2. <hi>A wild Aſſe in the wilderneſs that ſnuffs up the wind,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 24. and yet they plead innocence, and ſaid, <hi>I am not polluted,</hi> verſ. 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.10, <hi>&amp;c. They would walk after their own hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till they became like a rotten girdle, good for nothing, though God choſe them to be for a People, a Name, a Praiſe, and a Glory, yet they would not hear, nor obey, till God would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pity, nor ſpare, nor have mercy, but daſh them one againſt another, and deſtroy them,</hi> verſ. 14. becauſe they were ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in evil,</hi> like the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> or <hi>Leopard,</hi> that can change neither <hi>skin,</hi> nor <hi>ſpots,</hi> verſ. 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11, 12. They took up the like deſparate reſolution, (and word <hi>Noaſh</hi>) to walk after their own devices; to which they added, to deviſe Miſchief againſt the Prophet, who gave

            <p>☞ This hath been our Maſter a great while, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> we know it by woful experience too well, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explication: But this is not the ſword in the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and this is the ſword in the Text, and is here ſaid to be <hi>The Word of God,</hi> and to this only we ſpeak, for we have not to do with natural words, which men utter with their mouths by ſpeech to expreſs their minds one to another in this place from this Text.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Spiritual Sword,</hi> the <hi>word of God;</hi> is either, 1. <hi>Eſſential,</hi> or, 2. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological.</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173117:121"/>
               <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us:</hi> this is the Eſſential and uncreated word: and in Scripture, two ſpecial At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are aſcrib'd as peculiar to the ſon of God, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity: 1. <hi>The wiſdom of the Father,</hi> Prov. 8.14, to 36. 2. <hi>The Word of the Father,</hi> John 1.1. Theſe two Epithites Chriſt claims to himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 1.18. When he ſaith, <hi>No man knows the Father, nor hath ſeen God, ſave the Son:</hi> In this he aſſumeth to be his Fathers Wiſdom: We are not wiſe enough to aſcend to ſuch an height. And to be his <hi>Word,</hi> in that he revealeth, and doth declare him unto men; In which reſpect, <hi>he is called a Prophet:</hi> And that <hi>Prophet,</hi> Deut. 18.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theological</hi> or <hi>divine word</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to men, viz. The holy Scripture of the old and New Teſtament, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28.

            <p>Ap. <hi>This is a created and inſpired word, to make us wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1. 19, 20, 21. <hi>We
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:173117:122"/>have a ſure word of Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. And this Word of God made known to us by Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Good,</hi> ſo ſaid <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20.19. though the Meſſage was ſad. And the Lord himſelf ſaid, <hi>I will perform my good word to you after ſeventy years,</hi> Jer. 29.10. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6. Ye hear the danger of them that have taſted the good word of God, if they fall away: their caſe is woful. And this Word of God that is ſo good, is alſo,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Pure;</hi> Pſalm 119.140. <hi>Very pure,</hi> Ergo, Thy ſervant loveth it; yea, Every word of God is <hi>pure,</hi> ſaith wiſe <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30.5.</p>

            <p n="7">7. It is <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then any two-edged ſword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb: 4.12, 13.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Which moſt properly may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Chriſt; For he is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Quick,</hi> i.e. living, beholding the thoughts and actions of men, to reward them accordingly: To diſtinguiſt Chriſt from Idols, which can ſee, nor do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115.4.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Powerful,</hi> i. e. omniſcient, and able to execute wrath upon the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And ſharper then a two-edged ſword,</hi> which eaſily enters, and makes way for it felf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So Chriſt (who is omniſcient) doth eaſily enter, ſee, and ſearch the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts and inventions of the heart; for all things are naked and open unto the eys of him with whom we have to do.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:173117:123"/>
            <p n="2">2. This is alſo appliable to the word of God made known to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that in all the fore-named reſpects: for it alſo is <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> and ſharper than any ſword, and is therefore ſtyled, <hi>The rod and ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> Iſa. 11.4. wherewith the Lord ſhall, conſume, and ſlay the wicked as with a ſword, ſharp and of two edges, as it is in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.16. where he ſpeaks of Chriſt, and his Word to his Church, and to the Nations of the world: And as it is thus applyed to the Word of God, and of Chriſt made known to the world, ſo is it alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the Word of God in the <hi>mouths</hi> of his Prophets, Apoſtles ond Miniſters. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.2. <hi>He,</hi> i.e. <hi>God hath made my mouth like a ſharp ſword;</hi> (as well as a Rod, as it is called before) where you muſt conſider, that <hi>Mouth</hi> is put for the <hi>Word</hi> (of the Prophet) as it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture: <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.21. <hi>He did, (Numb.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>according to the mouth,</hi> i.e. <hi>Commandment of Pharoah.</hi> Moſes numbred them according to the <hi>mouth,</hi> i.e. The Word of the Lord, as he was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:173117:123"/>commanded. Conſider alſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who it was that made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets mouth thus like a ſharp ſword, <hi>it was God the Father,</hi> from whom all power is derived and communicated to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. It is he only that hath made his word (in the mouths of his Meſſengers) to be a ſword of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient power, and of admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To what end and purpoſe their Mouths are made ſo ſharp. I anſwer, To ſubdue mens ſouls to the obedience of it; even as men do ſubdue Nations by the power of a material ſword: ſo by this ſpiritual ſword, the Lord doth ſubdue us to the obedience of Chriſt: And it is ſo with the mouths of Gods Meſſengers, if you diſtinguiſh of it objective, and have reſpect to the Objects and Parties whom it doth moſt concern, to this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, <hi>viz.</hi> either for, 1. <hi>Evil</hi> and Deſtruction to the wicked, by denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and menaces of wrath againſt ſuch. 2. It is for the good and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the godly, by promiſes of Mercy and Goodneſs to them.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:173117:124"/>
            <p n="3">3. And both theſe ſhall be thus effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought to paſs, by publiſhing that Word of God which is by him put into their mouths to theſe ends; and all this ſhall as aſſuredly be fulfilled and effected, as if they had done it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or had ſeen it with their eyes.</p>
            <p>☞ This is the work of Prophets and Apoſtles, the Meſſengers and Miniſters of Chriſt, to do and perform in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubſerviency to him; and then they have done their duty: This you may ſee eminently in the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Jer.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Behold, ſaith the Lord, I have put my words in thy mouth: To be as his mouth,</hi> Jer. 15.19. <hi>To ſeparate the precious from the vile.</hi> Note, that God ſends no dumb Meſſengers: <hi>And he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Prophet, and did ſet him over the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For theſe ends, as above named, <hi>to root out, or pluck up, to pull down, and to deſtroy, as alſo to build and to plant,</hi> Jer. 12. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And by the ſame means before mentioned; See God himſelf explaining this to the Prophet; <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173117:124"/>
               <hi>If he threaten a Nation, and they repent, then God will repent: And if he make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to a Nation, and bleſs them,</hi> if they abuſe all then, not that God repenteth as man doth through over-ſight, or want of fore-caſt, or out of ſickleneſs and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of mind, for ſuch grounds of Repentance are imperfections in man, <hi>and cannot befal God,</hi> Numb. 23.19. But God is ſaid to repent, <hi>when he doth, as men uſe to do when they repent,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 33, 34. When he revoketh a doom that he had paſt, and ſtayeth the execution of a ſentence formerly denounced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>God repented that he had made man,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. <hi>That he had ſet up</hi> Saul <hi>to be King;</hi> which doom and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as it was denounced, becauſe of mans ſin; ſo it is reverſed, when man ceaſeth ſo to do, the end being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for which it was denounced, <hi>viz.</hi> that it might not be inflicted, as <hi>ver.</hi> 7. So that as the School-men ſay, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in man is a change of the mind or Will:</hi> But with God, <hi>It is the willing of a change, his mind and purpoſe abiding ſtill the ſame,</hi> as Jer. 20.16.</p>

            <p>☞ Not that God doth repent out of over-ſight, or defect of fore-caſt, or mutability of mind, as men do; but when he revoketh the doom he had paſſed, and ſtays the Execution what he had denounced: when his own end is accompliſhed, either in the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the wicked, or perſeverance of the godly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom, and to which end all the Menaces and Promiſes, Threatnings and Encouragements of God are made: All which Menaces and Promiſes are ever to be underſtood with the condition or reſervation there expreſſed by Almighty God. How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſoever they appear, or by us may be apprehended in their Terms or Words.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You have alſo heard the praiſes of this Sword, the Word of God, out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.7.8, 9. in fix particulars.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And that it is uſually compared to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:173117:127"/>incorruptible ſeed in ſeveral Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And alſo the Arguments or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this point; <hi>viz.</hi> That,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The word of God is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſword, wherewith he doth defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and offend his ſpiritual adverſaries:</hi> I ſay the Reaſons do ariſe from its own Excellency in the uſe of it: And the Author of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Here the War is ſpiritual, and ſo is the Enemy, and ſo alſo is the Sword: All are ſpiritual; and <hi>Ergo,</hi> Thus ſuited one to another in this Warfare.</p>
            <p>☞ But the Reaſons will meet with a further illuſtration in the Application of this point: To which now I do now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And the Uſes of this point are of Information.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Word of God is the ſword of all the faithful, wherewith to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to offend their ſpiritual adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to withſtand, repel, ſubdue, and cut off all Satans temptations, and other corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which war againſt our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11.</p>
            <p>☞ Now the Word of God is called
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:173117:128"/>
               <hi>The ſword of the Spirit,</hi> becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit maketh this Weapon to our hands, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. For holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Sword ſlayeth our ſpiritual enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſo ſharp, that it pierceth to the dividing of the Soul and Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. of the Joynts and Marrow, yea of the Heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is no carnal, but a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Weapon: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have a brief account of what hath been already done; we are now come to the Uſe &amp; improvement of the point. You know upon this I entered the laſt day, but I could only name ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to you, not having time to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any of them.</p>
            <p>Of theſe therefore let me now ſpeak a little more at large. The ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies I then named unto you, were, 1. Satan. 2. The Sins of great ones. 3. Errours, Hereſies, and evil Opinions.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:173117:128"/>Self-intereſts and unrighteouſneſs. And, 5. The unruly Tranſgreſſions and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes of all people.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Uſe of Information: This Uſe doth inform us of the Excellency of this Sword in the uſe of it, both in the way of Offence and Defence, to ſubdue and ſupport.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And for Offence, the firſt enemy to be encountered with, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Satan, He is a fierce, cruel and crafty Adverſary; Of whom you have heard before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12. This is he that encountered our Saviour in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.</p>
            <p>In which Temptation you ſhall find him (<hi>Proteus</hi>-like) changing his skin, and acting a threefold perſon: but a Tempter he will be in every ſhape, ſtill aiming at evil, and endeavouring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He will be an Hermit in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will viſit Chriſt as a friend to adviſe him: not to faſt over-long, nor to hurt himſelf with hunger: and mark here the,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Satanae,</hi> the Devils entrance
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:173117:129"/>upon the enſuing Temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Chriſti,</hi> the Riſiſtance of Chriſt thereunto: Chriſt had faſted long, and was now an hungred: and hereupon he takes occaſion to begin: The devil takes Chriſt at the weakeſt: this is his practiſe ſtill: note,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>As he did by Chriſt, ſo he will do by all: when we are weakeſt, then he will be buſie at work with us to ſeduce and deſtroy us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Devil obſerved the preaching of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.34. <hi>I ſaw, and bare record that this is the Son of God;</hi> 2. <hi>And that voice from heaven at the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Christ,</hi> Mat. 3.17. Yet he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether Chriſt was ſo indeed, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> now he comes to try, and ſift it out by this Temptation: for ſaith he, <hi>thou art now hungry,</hi> which doth not befall to God, nor the ſon of God; But I will grant that thou art ſo, <hi>Then turn theſe ſtones into bread:</hi> for God can change the nature of things at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But if thou canſt not do this, thou art neither God, nor the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mark how the devil ſtrikes at the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173117:129"/>Deity of Chriſt, and at our Faith, by raiſing ſuch a doubt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But mark now the <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of Chriſt to this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He doth not ſay, <hi>I am God,</hi> and ſo drive him away.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But he takes up the ſword of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Deut. 8.3. and therewith drives him away: for having granted that Bread; and bodily food is the uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt hunger; Yet ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>There is no neceſsity for me to do ſo: For if I be the Son of God, know thou, That God is not bound to ſupport by bread only, as Nature is, and men are by the ordinary way of proviſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But he hath many other ways and means to ſuſtain and nouriſh us withall: <hi>Though here be no bread,</hi> yet know, it is not <hi>Bread</hi> only, or other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary food that doth nouriſh any man, but by Gods appointment of it to that end, and bleſſing upon it; Beſides God can ſupport and ſupply us miraculouſly, He can nouriſh us without any food, or put the vertue of food into other things,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:173117:130"/>and can make poyſon to be both meat and medicine, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. and <hi>Ergo, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon him will I wait,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and ſo let us do alſo: <hi>Exit Satan,</hi> he hath done with this ſhape, and this Temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devil acts the part of a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint, a devout Zelot: <hi>He will go</hi> (next) <hi>to the holy City, and try what he can do there; He taketh up Chriſt, and carrieth him, as Gods Spirit did</hi> Philip, Acts 8.39. <hi>He caught him away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Mark what the Devil can do, if God permit, he can carry away wicked men quick into hell:</hi> And wonder not that Chriſt ſuffered the Devil to carry him, who ſuffered his Inſtruments to crucifie him: When he had brought Chriſt thither, he ſets him upon a Pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a place as fit, as dangerous, to ſerve his turn, to tempt our Saviour.</p>
            <p>The City, the Temple, all here mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of piety, of the true worſhip of God; and here the Devil will turn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; (and becauſe Chriſt had foil'd him with Scripture before) he will cite Scripture too, and perſwade Chriſt to leap down, upon the Reaſon alledged in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> Pſal. 91.11, 12.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:173117:130"/>
            <p>Doct. Note, 1. <hi>We muſt take heed of Temptations in the Church, in holy places, and duties, in great Aſſemblies, as well as in the Wilderneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil did not caſt Chriſt down, but bid him caſt himſelf down.</p>
            <p>Doct. Note, 2. <hi>The Devil may tempt and perſwade to evil, he cannot compel,</hi> Hoc tantum pertinet quod egit in principio, Seducere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iraeneus. The Devil cites Scripture, but withal, he adds and concealeth at his pleaſure, (<hi>viz.</hi> Caſt thy ſelf down, and to keep thee in all thy ways, miſinterpreteth, and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, averteth all, (as impious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, his Diſciples do) <hi>Mendacium ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondens per Scripturam, quod faciunt omnes Haeretici,</hi> ſaith <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note 3. <hi>That no Temptation of Satan is more pernicious and dangerous, than that which is coloured with miſapplied Scripture, and ſhew of ſanctity;</hi> But beware the Devil and his Miniſters when they are like Angels of Light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus the Devil perſwaded Chriſt to tempt God, hoping to find him either to be an Impoſter, if he received
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:173117:131"/>hurt by the fall, or the Son of God by preſerving himſelf in the fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But mark how Chriſt (with the ſame Weapon, this Sword (foils him again, by producing a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition that concerneth all men; <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ye ſhall not tempt the Lord,</hi> q. d. It becomes none to tempt God, much leſs him whom I know, (and thou doubteſt to be the Son of God.</p>
            <p>☞ And then is God tempted, when ordinary means are neglected, beſides and againſt the Counſel and Warrant of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And ſo ſhould I do, if (neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtairs by which I may deſcend with ſafety, I ſhould <hi>(Sponte, non juſſus a Patre, ſolum a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. He acts the part of a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and will try what great gifts will do; and they uſe to do much, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes him up into an exceeding
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:173117:131"/>high mountain; a fit place for oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to take the proſpect and view of many excellent Things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There he ſhews him all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, and the glory of them: <hi>i.e.</hi> The Excellency, Riches, Splendor, Beauty, and whatſoever is admirable in them; and theſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to Chriſts ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, by Viſion at leaſt, elſe he could not do it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All theſe he impudently claims as his own, and in his power to diſpoſe of, &amp; promiſeth to give them all to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His only demand was, <hi>Proſtratus adora me,</hi> do but fall down, and worſhip me, and all ſhall be thine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> A dangerous tentation, and made up of lies and miſchief! how th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nk you, would ſuch a Promiſe have prevailed with many a Worldling.</p>
            <p>Doct. Note, <hi>That the glory of the world is a choice bait of the devil to catch and enſnare mens ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mark how Chriſt doth anſwer this his moſt abominable preſumption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To his Perſon, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Abi Satana,</hi> Get thee hence Satan, be gone blaſphemous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173117:132"/>Devil; This he ſpake with ſuch Authority, that he durſt ſtay no longer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then to his Temptation, he takes up the ſame Weapon, the Sword of the Spirit, as before, and out of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. and 10.12, 20. and 13.4. which Chriſt citeth thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> Thou thinkeſt that if I do not worſhip thee, then I am the Son of God: but if I do, then thou knoweſt I am not the Son of God: <hi>Be gone Devil,</hi> and know you, that it is an univerſal Precept and Command up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Creature, <hi>To give divine honour unto God their Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus the Devil by a threefold Temptation tryes to know who Chriſt is, whether the Son of God or not; and when all is done, he is forc'd to be gone, as wiſe as he came to him, without any ſatisfaction. Thus did he do by Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> He did act as a friend in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, or divine in the <hi>Temple,</hi> a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Monarch in the world with great promiſes, but prevailed not.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:173117:132"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And if he did thus by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, what will he not do by us? he will try all his wiles and ſhapes.</p>
            <p>Hence is the great difficulty of our right uſing, wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing &amp; arming this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon well againſt him: For ſometimes he acteth as the Prince of Darkneſs, then as the red Dragon, as an Angel of light, one while he tempteth to deſparation, then to preſumption, now he frights with Terrours, the frowns of men, loſs of preferment; Then with promiſes of the worlds glory (if you will worſhip him) and of all deſirable things, as he did by our Saviour.</p>
            <p>He tryes every way to ſeduce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us; and therefore we had need to learn the uſe of this Weapon very well, to be ready to repel his manifold and various Temptations: <hi>Take therefore the ſword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, to reſiſt the Devil that he may flee from you,</hi> Jam. 4.7.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond Enemy to withſtand with this <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> was the ſins of great Men. How plain were the Prophets of old with Kings and Princes,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:173117:133"/>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> with <hi>Saul, Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> with <hi>David</hi> about <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and numbring the people; <hi>Elijah</hi> with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and with <hi>Jehoram</hi> alſo; ſo alſo was <hi>Micaiah</hi> with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> with <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> for helping <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo <hi>Eliazer</hi> alſo for his joyning with <hi>Ahaziah, Shemaiah</hi> with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and a Prophet with <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> alſo, <hi>Hanam</hi> the Seer with <hi>Aſa,</hi> and another Prophet <hi>Amaziah, Zechariah,</hi> King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> with <hi>choram, Jeremiah</hi> with <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> with <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt with wicked <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus Kings and Princes of old did hear and bear the Rebukes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and thoſe that did obey and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form according to their Counſel, did fare the better: And thoſe that reſiſted and miſuſed the Prophets for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, did but reſiſt to their own ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now the only thing that makes it ſo difficult to manage this ſword againſt the Mighty, is,</p>
            <p>☞ Becauſe they do ſo harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Reproof, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:173117:133"/>no controul. They are ſtrait in <hi>Aſas</hi> fit of anger, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. for which he ſmarted: Or elſe in <hi>Ahabs</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. Or like the Princes in <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s time, that would never let him be quiet, but vexed him with one thing or other, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Errours, Hereſies and evil Opinions of all ages and times; Theſe are another Enemy to be dealt with, with this Weapon: Theſe are thoſe Gordian knots that have always been cut aſunder with this ſword: For this, peruſe the Riſe, and Ruine of Errours and Hereſies out of the Antients, and ſo from time to time.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Yet theſe ſtrengthen themſelves mightily with that reſolution mentioned by <hi>Auguſtine, Nondum perſuadebis, etiamſi perſuaſeris,</hi> They will not be converted, though they be ſufficiently convinced.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They plead the Spirit as much as any, (but without trial) though it be as much of deluſion as confuſion; of which we have much experience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They cite Scripture (this ſword) abundantly, though miſerably maimed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:173117:134"/>perverted, miſinterpreted and miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that purpoſe, <hi>yet they will not ſee wherein they fail,</hi> though their <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>miſtakes</hi> be diſcovered with the cleareſt eye, and doomed to ſilence by the moſt impartial judgement.</p>
            <p>☞ But it hath been their <hi>uſual courſe</hi> to run themſelves out of breath in their own endleſs Mazes, till they fall aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſſolve, and vaniſh to <hi>nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The next enemy to encounter with this Sword, is <hi>Self-ſeeking, ſelf-intereſts,</hi> and <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> of men. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is point-blank oppoſite and croſs to that Grace of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> ſo much recommended to us by our Saviour Chriſt: <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>If any man will come after me:</hi> and practiſed by the Worthies of all ages, who have denyed themſelves in their own Will, Mind, and ſinful Affections.</p>
            <p>In the caſes of <hi>Pleaſure, Profit, Honor</hi> and <hi>Preferment,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus did <hi>Abraham; Gen.</hi> 13.8 <hi>In his Son, as well as in his ſeniority, to</hi> Lot <hi>his Nephew.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I am heartily forry that I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this branch of this Uſe with an obſervation of my own experience, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I have heard and read many Sermons of theſe our times:</hi> In which if you do well view the ſubject of the diſcourſe in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173117:137"/>the Text (under hand) you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>Sword, Bright,</hi> and <hi>brandiſhed,</hi> drawn forth <hi>glittering</hi> and <hi>ſhining;</hi> and you would think it would do marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or wonderful Execution; but when it comes to the upſhot, if you obſerve it, you ſhall find as well as I, that the Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Preacher</hi> hath learned the Art, to make the <hi>point of this ſword</hi> ſo blunt, and the edge of it ſo dull, <hi>that it ſhall neither pierce nor cut,</hi> neither ſearch nor hurt, no nor give any wound at all (in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.) to them that ſtand in moſt need of ſuch a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I am not ignorant that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of preaching, <hi>viz. That there is a ſoul-ſaving, a ſelf-pleaſing, and a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, or men-pleaſing preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The laſt, <hi>viz. The Tim-ſerving</hi> is beſt accepted; He that can daub with <hi>untempered morter,</hi> and make pillows for mens elbows; that can cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> when there is no peace, <hi>and with lies make the heart of the righteous ſad, and ſtreng then the hands of the wicked by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them life,</hi> Ezek. 13. The Apoſtle <hi>St Paul</hi> did not ſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <pb n="257" facs="tcp:173117:137"/>
            <p>Theſe are the men that are moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whileſt they hate him that rebukes or reproves in the gate, and abhor him that ſpeaketh uprightly, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing-Preacher,</hi> who doth improve all his Abilities, Parts, Learning, Reading, Pregnancy of wit, or Elegancy of ſpeech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for oftentation, more then edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſet forth himſelf; ſuch a man is a man of eſteem: Though the religious, wiſe and judicious Auditors can ſay, <hi>That he ſought his own glory more then the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ This St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not (though as well able as any) for ſaith he; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>My ſpeech and my preaching was not with entiſing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But the firſt of theſe three, <hi>viz. The Soul-ſaving Preacher,</hi> is the only <hi>He</hi> that does the work, heals the wound, and effects the cure, though he hath leaſt thanks for his labour, and is worſt reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>☞ Yet this is he that hath beſt ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and learned the Preachers charge,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:173117:138"/>and is moſt careful to obſerve the rule of God. <hi>Ezek</hi> 3.17. <hi>Son of man I have made thee a Watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: he hath learned not to be afraid of mens faces, nor diſmaid at their words, though they be among briars and thorns, and dwell among Scorpions.</hi> Ezek. 2.6. Jer. 1.7. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command thee, thou ſhalt ſpeak:</hi> This is his practiſe, and for ſucceſs and reward he waits upon God.</p>
            <p>And if I may out of unfeigned love to you all, and eſpecially to all ſuch as would gladly ſee the face of our late times, of themſelves, and of their own ſouls (in reference to the Times) in a clear Cryſtal glaſs, which will neither flatter you, nor detract from any.</p>
            <p>I would recommend the renowned Sermons preached lately before Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſſemblies, and upon publick oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, by that truly Reverend Dr <hi>John Gauden</hi> Preacher at the Temple: of whom without prejudice of any others, (whoſe learned labours I have alſo read) I will only ſay (in reference to our late Times) as <hi>Solomons</hi> mother doth of the vertuous Wife, and that with little variation of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:173117:138"/>the words; <hi>Many Preachers have done worthily, but thou ſurmountest</hi> (or excelleſt) <hi>them all,</hi> Prov. 31.30.</p>
            <p>You have heard the firſt branch of this Uſe of Information, informing us how to make uſe of this ſword, by way of offence againſt our ſpiritual enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt Satan, the ſins of great men, Errours and Hereſies, the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many, and the unrulineſs of the Multitudes who are ſet on miſchief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do now deſcend to the ſecond Branch of this uſe, which doth inform how this ſword is Defenſive of our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the very ſubduing of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, this ſword doth prove to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of our ſelves. 1. <hi>Gideon</hi> overcame the <hi>Midianites,</hi> Judg. 7. 2. And <hi>David</hi> the Philiſtines, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> the Ammonites, 2 <hi>Chrou.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>Aſa</hi> the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 14. 5. And the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> Num. 11.2.3. All which was done by the Word and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lord; and by the right uſe of this Sword of the Spirit, as well as by the material Sword, the very over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:173117:139"/>of their enemies, did produce the ſafety and preſervation of themſelves. So alſo, when all the godly (by the help of God, and this ſword of the Spirit, which God hath directed us to make uſe of to that end) I ſay, when all godly men do overcome and conquer the fleſh, the devil, and the worlds vanities: Even in ſo doing, they do defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt way in which this Sword doth prove defenſive to us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This ſword is defenſive, in that it doth inſtruct and furniſh every man for his own proper place, calling and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of what degree ſoever; This is a teaching ſword. 1. <hi>Joſhua</hi> was made a wiſe and valiant Captain, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Huſhai</hi> was made a wiſe Counſellour, and overmatched <hi>Achithophel</hi> by this. 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> was made a wiſe King by this, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.3. 4. And <hi>Timothy</hi> a wiſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. 5. And the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is inſtructed by this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.23. This is a ſtudy for all: For Kings. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now the <hi>fitter</hi> any man is for his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:173117:139"/>own lawful <hi>imployment,</hi> the ſafer he is: <hi>Diligence in Duty is our ſafety,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> hath the leſs advantage againſt us: The Bird upon the wing in <hi>flight</hi> is ſafe from <hi>Gun-ſhot,</hi> till ſhe ſtoop to the lure; the <hi>Bait</hi> laid for her, then <hi>ſhe is in danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ <hi>David</hi> in his Wars, and <hi>Solomon</hi> whileſt in pious Works of building the <hi>Temple,</hi> were very <hi>right in their way;</hi> But when at eaſe, and out of good imployments, each of them <hi>met with a fiery dart of the devil:</hi> The firſt <hi>by anothers mans wife,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. And the ſecond by a <hi>multitude of Wives,</hi> 1 King. 11.1. which made a <hi>wound,</hi> and <hi>left a ſcar,</hi> almoſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible,</hi> which before they were free from.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is by <hi>the inſtruction of this ſword, the word of God that Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>That Kingdoms are eſtabliſhed and proſpered, yea the very foundations of the earth were laid, and the heavens eſtabliſhed, and all things governed by this Word:</hi> Thit is <hi>the beſt ſword of defence</hi> for any <hi>Countrey, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> yea, and for <hi>the whole world:</hi> Where this is <hi>wanting,</hi> there is
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:173117:140"/>no <hi>ſafety,</hi> but all goes to wrack; <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are naked, and expoſed to all kind of Trouble, Danger and Deſtruction,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.3, to 7.</p>
            <p>☞ In this lies <hi>the hope of</hi> Englands <hi>happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> through the <hi>want</hi> of this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath a <hi>great influence</hi> upon life it ſelf: <hi>For by it our dayes are prolonged,</hi> Deut 32.46 47. <hi>And the years of our life increaſed,</hi> Prov. 9. <hi>By this our ways are made ſafe, and our ſleep ſecured,</hi> Prov. 3.23, 24. <hi>And our life it ſelf is given and defended hereby,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.12. Wiſdom is a defence, and money is a defence, but the excellency of knowledge is, <hi>That wiſdom giveth life to them that have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. By this Sword we do defend our (ſelves in our) beſt <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>abilities:</hi> For by this our <hi>Souls</hi> are converted, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings</hi> enlightned, <hi>Thoughts</hi> purged, <hi>Affections</hi> ſanctified, <hi>Wills</hi> confirmed to the Will of God, <hi>Memories</hi> ſtored, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> cleared, <hi>Hearts</hi> changed, cheared and comforted, which before were as flint or Adamant.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:173117:140"/>
            <p n="6">6. With this <hi>Sword</hi> we defend all our Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, Patience, Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. With this <hi>Sword</hi> we do defend our ſelves from and againſt <hi>Idolatry, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Hereſie; Strange Religions, Mens Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Carnal ſecurity, Preſumption in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Deſperation of Mercy, Idleneſs, Evil Company, Pride and vain Glory,</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> uſually practiſed by men in ſeveral kinds, as you may ſee more at large in Mr. <hi>Tho. Becons</hi> Book, intituled <hi>The Governance of Vertue,</hi> printed above an hundred years ago.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe things lead me to a ſecond Uſe of Exhortation: For ſince this ſword of the Spirit is ſo exceedingly uſeful, both for offence and defence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be perſwaded, to let the Word of God dwell in us richly or plentifully as <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And let us labour to be like <hi>Apollo</hi> mighty in the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24, 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to uſe this ſword ſo well in our ſeveral Stations, Vocations and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as that according to our ability
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:173117:141"/>and opportunity, we may become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, that ignorant men may be inſtructed, diſordered men reformed, dull Memories quickned, cold zeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the afflicted comforted, and the diſtreſſed relieved, that errour may be convinced, vice corrected, death may be avoided, and life eternal through Chriſt obtained. In a word, to conclude; by this Word the righteouſneſs of God is revealed, the Church is ſanctified, and at laſt everlaſtingly ſaved, and glorified in heaven, ſo that we may well conclude with the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34, 35. <hi>He is a bleſſed man that heareth, attendeth upon, and gaineth wiſdom by this word:</hi> And with the Kingly Prophet his father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. <hi>That in the keeping</hi> (and making a right uſe of) <hi>this word, there is</hi> (true true ſafety, as well as) a <hi>great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This verſe leads me to, and gives us in the laſt piece, <hi>viz.</hi> the 7th. of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Armour, wherewith to reſiſt theſe mighty enemies before cited: And this ſeventh piece of Armour is propounded laſt, yet not as the leaſt, and moſt uſeleſs piece of the reſt, but of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:173117:141"/>in reference to all the reſt: For we are commanded before; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 13. <hi>To be ſtrong in the Lord, to take unto us, and to put on the whole armour of God;</hi> and how ſhall this be done without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God to help us herein? Beſides, how ſhall we get any good, either in the way of offence or defence by all the former pieces, <hi>viz. Truth, Righteouſneſs, Goſpel, Faith, Hope,</hi> and the <hi>ſword</hi> before named, if God do not furniſh us with them, and give us wiſdom and ſtrength to make uſe of them aright, until we have gained the victory: Thefore to all theſe (to bring up the rear) and alſo to arm you compleatly, add this ſeventh and laſt piece of our ſpiritual armour, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer and Supplication; betwixt which (I think) you need not make uſe of that nice diſtinction betwixt them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Prayer is put for Deprecation of ſome evil or temptation that it might not overtake us. And Supplication is an earneſt requeſt to God for his help and grace againſt the evil of Temptations <hi>that may befal us:</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:173117:142"/>did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. both the words being promiſcuouſly uſed, and uſually taken for the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Now this laſt piece of our armour is both offenſive and defenſive; it ſubdues our enemy, and ſupports our ſelves; and this Prayer and Supplication, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Oratio &amp; Obſecratio,</hi> Arias Mont. Thus conjoyned together, do intimate to us the very nature of Adoration, when any one doth humble himſelf before God, and doth ask any thing of him, and doth imply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An acknowledgement of the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Ergo</hi> doth <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>obſecrate</hi> him as the only God and Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And of his own <hi>Indigence,</hi> which ſets him upon <hi>ſupplication</hi> for help; and this is the firſt condition of <hi>true prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conditions of Prayer are divers; you have had the firſt: And,</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Always,,</hi> (i. e.) in every opportunity, as oſt as neceſſity requires. When <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> invade and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail vs, we had need fly to God, and have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:173117:142"/>recourſe to Chriſt for help, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver,</hi> Luke 18.1, 7, 8. That men ought alwayes to pray.</p>
            <p>Note, That he ſpeaks of free, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers, and occaſional; Not of the ordinary prayers of the Church, or ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Families; nor in favour of them that are ever babling, as the <hi>(Euchitae)</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hereticks, who rejected all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Vocations, <hi>Alſted.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sclat.</hi> p. 508.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Prayer muſt be in the Spirit, the holy Spirit is the procreant cauſe of our prayers, and our own ſpirits muſt be ſet to work alſo: it muſt not be only with our lips or in Hypocriſie, as they did, <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.13. that drew near God with the mouth, and with lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with a faithfull underſtanding and devout mind, that is, intent upon God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth his promiſes, <hi>Eſt enim ſpiritus Anima or ationis, ut anima eſt forma, &amp; vita corporis, corpus ſive anima putidum eſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daver, ſic Oratio ſine ſpiritu,</hi> Zanchius.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It muſt be conjoyn'd with vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and perſeverance, watching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with all perſeverance, as Chriſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:173117:143"/>ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> This implies a Fervency, that we be not dull, languid and tyred with praying, but to hold out conſtantly.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It muſt be accompanied with Charity for others, as well as for our ſelves: It muſt be for all Saints, all our fellow-Souldiers militant here on earth, thoſe triumphant in Heaven need them not. Theſe prayers that are charitable and fervent, are very prevalent, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. the effectual, fervent prayer, <hi>&amp;c. Elias</hi> is an inſtance of ſuch prayers.</p>
            <p>Note, None are ſo good, but that they ſtand in need of prayers. And for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.27, 28. as our Saviour Chriſt, and Saint <hi>Steven</hi> the firſt Martyr, did, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Now if you ask me what prayer is, I anſwer, <hi>Quid ſit.</hi> Prayer is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a ſoul lifted up to God, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for ſomething ſuitable with Gods Will, on the behalf of our ſelves and others, in aſſurance to be heard, and accepted by him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thanks accordingly for mercies obtained.</p>
            <pb n="269" facs="tcp:173117:143"/>
            <p n="2">2. It is the ſouls Requeſt to God, for ſtrong deſires of heart go for loud cryes in the Eares of Almighty God. <hi>Moſes</hi> did thus at the Red ſea, he lift up his heart to God, and the Lord ſaid, <hi>Why cryeſt thou unto me,</hi> Exod. 14.15. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake no word, but in the earneſt deſire of his heart; So <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed for a Son, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, 13. in her heart, though her voyce was not heard, <hi>Eli</hi> heard her not, but God heard her, and granted her Requeſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 19, 20, 26, 27. So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (2.4.) did, when he attended at the Table, and it ſucceeded well, <hi>Non vox ſed votum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Theſe Requeſts, Deſires, and Liftings up of the heart, muſt be only to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>You ſhall worſhip the Lord your God, and him only ſhall you ſerve.</hi> And prayer and praiſe, are a ſpecial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.14, 15. <hi>Offer unto God Thankſgiving,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo alſo, <hi>Call upon me</hi> (ſaith God) Not go to Saints and Angels for help, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.15, 16. Look down from Heaven (ſaith the Church) doubtleſſe thou art our Father, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be ignorant of us, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:173117:144"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> acknowledge us not, and in thee only the Fatherleſſe findeth mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. In vain (therefore) it is to pray <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p n="3">III. They muſt be in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, (not of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14. and 15, 16. and 16.23, 24, 26. In my name, <hi>i. e.</hi> Through my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, for my merit ſake, I will do it, <hi>i.e.</hi> I will hear, and grant your Requeſts, becauſe I am able to perform it, <hi>to whom the Father hath committed all power,</hi> Mat. 28.18.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And all muſt be ſuitable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, and to his Glory, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14. <hi>This is our confidence, that if we ask any thing according to his</hi> (not our) <hi>will, he heareth us.</hi> We muſt learn of our Maſter, who ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> And did the ſame throughout his whole life, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. and 5 30. and 6.38. And taught us to pray, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> Mat. 6.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And all that we thus deſire on the behalf of our ſelves and others, muſt be with aſſurance. For he that cometh to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:173117:144"/>God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11.6. and this is the ground of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.24. And thus we are to draw near to our High Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt with a true heart, in ſull aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, having our hearts ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from an evil conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10.21.22. We muſt not be like them, mentioned in <hi>James</hi> 1.6, 7, 8. <hi>wavering, doubtful, and double-minded,</hi> &amp;c. ſo as to queſtion the Attributes of God, and whether he be able to ſave us, or will do it? Such a doubting excludes Faith and makes us like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, toſſed and broken to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>☞ Thus you have heard what prayer is, and the Definition thereof opened to you in the ſeveral Branches of it. If you ask, <hi>Quotuplex ſit?</hi> I anſwer, 1. Mentall only, in the Elevations of the thoughts and deſires unto God without voyce, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Ver. 2, 4. 2. Vocal, when by words we expreſſe the deſires of our hearts. Such was Chriſts prayer, who in the dayes of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:173117:145"/>his fleſh offered up prayers with ſtrong Crying and Tears. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. 3. Vital (or Real) (ſay ſome, <hi>Oratio vitalis</hi> (which is in a continued good life, <hi>Semper orat, qui ſemper bona facit.</hi> Gloſſ. Good works call for, and procure bleſſings, as ſome ſinnes cry in the Eares of the Lord. But the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Prayer,</hi> properly ſo called, which conſiſts in the two former kinds, Neutral, Vocal: There is <hi>Vox, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis, &amp; Sodomorum,</hi> Gen. 4.10. and 18.20. and 19.13. <hi>Abels</hi> blood, and the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> cryed loud for vengeance.</p>
            <p>Now, if the deſires be continual, Or we omit no ſet-times and ſeaſons of prayer; Or pray frequently, as occaſions require, or neceſſary Employments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Or, without ceaſing, <hi>i. e.</hi> without fainting, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. Or, beſides ſolemn and ſet-prayers, we make uſe of Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, darting out our deſies unto God, which may be done at any time.</p>
            <p>In all theſe wayes we may be ſaid to pray alwayes, or continually, becauſe, in all this diverſity, is no contrariety: and in all theſe we do lift up our ſouls, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.1. and pour out our hearts like water
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:173117:145"/>before the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. In ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and plentifully, as the Clouds do the Rain, or the Springs of water their ſtreams, and that in the Night as well as in the Day, at all times, and upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, lead us to the point of Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>True Chriſtians (who are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Souldiers in this war) muſt pray to God frequently and fervently, to Repel (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move) ſuch Evils: and to gain (or obtain) ſuch good things as are neceſſary for the ſouls or bodies of our ſelves, or others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This is frequently commanded us, we have Precepts in abundance. Take a few: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.8. and 50.15. When God ſaid, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> Davids heart ſaid, <hi>Thy face, O Lord I will ſeek.</hi> It were well if our hearts were in this tune; <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Eſay 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord, and call upon him while he is near,</hi> Mat. 7.7. and 11.28. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you. Come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>all ye that labour and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will give you reſt.</hi> James 5.13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c. Is any afflicted, let him pray</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:173117:146"/>Again, <hi>is any ſick,</hi> let him take the like courſe, prayer will ſave them. Hence the Apoſtle exhorteth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. That firſt of all, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Gratiarum, Actiones.</hi> 1. Supplications againſt evils. 2. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for good. 3. Interceſſions, for others. 4. And Thanks be for all: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> good, or bad, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. All theſe muſt be made, and performed, and that for all men, <hi>i. e.</hi> All kinds of men, <hi>Jewes, Gentiles, Bond, Free, Believers</hi> &amp; <hi>Infidels Friends</hi> or <hi>Foes, Great men,</hi> or <hi>mean ones, publick</hi> and <hi>private.</hi> Or all ſorts and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men, howſoever qualified or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned.

If they be not ſo good men as we could wiſh them, yet we muſt pray for them (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was to do for <hi>Babylon,</hi>) though not out of any ſpecial affection to ſuch a State. Yet in regard of our own intereſt and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:173117:146"/>ſhare in the common Reſt and quietneſs of a Nation; In which as in a Veſſel, wherein we are all Embarqued, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. Thus are Supplications and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be made for all Men.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Of this you have a Cloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a multitude of Examples that have led us the way in this practiſe of Prayer: <hi>viz.</hi> Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and others mentioned in Scripture, have been abundant in prayers both for themſelves and others: a few Examples may ſuffice inſtead of many. <hi>David pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven times a day,</hi> Pſa. 119.164. and praiſed God, &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi> thrice, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. (as alſo <hi>David</hi> did) <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55.17. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the great danger he was in by a Decree. <hi>Anna</hi> ſerved the Lord with faſtings and prayer, night and day, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.37. continually as occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And our Saviour himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from other company, and ſpent whole Nights in prayer to God (beſides his ordinary and daily Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. to teach us vigilancy, and perſeverance in prayer. Oh what ſhould we do in this kind for our own
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:173117:147"/>Salvation, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſpent whole Nights in prayer for us. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> l 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6. And how ſhould we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our backwardneſſe and ſluggiſhneſs hereunto, and herein. And to this (<hi>viz.</hi> To our frequent and fervent prayers) we have as many promiſes &amp; performances (in manner) as we have Precepts, and Preſidents, Commands and Examples. Take a few: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.14, 15. Becauſe he hath ſet his Love upon me, therefore I will deliver him, and ſet him high, he ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him, be with, deliver and honour him; Mark, how love to God, and prayer to him are conjoin'd, and God enables us to pray, and then anſwereth us, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.24. <hi>Before they call I will anſwer,</hi> and whiles they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear, <hi>i.e.</hi> and I will be more forward to grant then they to crave, more ready to anſwer then they to ask. And did not God do thus by <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 32.5. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin; David</hi> was in the Future, God in the preter tenſe , <hi>Daniel</hi> (10.2.) <hi>Daniel</hi> was mourning three full weeks, an Hand
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:173117:147"/>touched him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and told him, that from the firſt day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his words, prayers, were heard; This was a good Hand (of an Angel, or Seraphim at the leaſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.6, 7.) and how good is that God who putteth forth ſuch an Hand for the ſtrength, encouragement, and comfort of his ſervants. And that prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18. He is reſolving to go to his father, to ſubmit and aſk mercy; the father ſaw (yet a great way off) &amp; had compaſſion &amp; ran, and fell on his neck &amp; kiſſed him; the Father made more haſt to meet him with mercy, then the Son did to ſeek it. And are not theſe great encouragements to this Duty? and is it not thus ever? Before the time cited to you, <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whiles he was ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> flies to him with an Anſwer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20 to 14 So <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. while <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the Word; yea when he began to ſpeak. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.15. Chriſt hath confirmed theſe Promiſes of God with <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> John 16.23. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my Name,</hi> &amp;c. So that you may make the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:173117:148"/>caſe general, which you have <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.4, 5, 6. <hi>I ſought the Lord and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears,</hi> &amp;c. This poor man cryed &amp; the Lord heard him and ſaved him out of all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; Thus every prayer-full man.</p>
            <p>To theſe Precepts, Preſidents and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may add Reaſons and Arguments: in reſpect of</p>
            <p n="1">I. God himſelf, becauſe he is the God able to ſave, and he alone, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.15. to 20. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayed, and mark the anſwer, and the ſucceſſe he had, <hi>v.</hi> 2 of to 37. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 63. throughout, <hi>O God, thou art my God,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe he is good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all that call upon him, <hi>Pſ,</hi> 86.3, 4 5. to 11. This is the Nature of God, <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 119 68. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we pray as he, <hi>Ariſe for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies ſake,</hi> Pſalm 44.29.</p>
            <p>He is a God in covenant with us, by a covenant of Grace, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.3. <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore we have recourſe to him, ſaying with the Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.9. <hi>Behold we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:173117:148"/>
            <p n="2">II. Our ſelves, and our own Eſtates: How do our manifold wants, in both: 1. Spiritual, and 2. Temporal; Things which are continual call upon us for this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of temporal things: how many miſeries and ſorrowes doth poor man meet with, that all may ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>I am poor and needy,</hi> Pſ. 40.11. and have need therefore to pray as he there; <hi>v.</hi> 11.13, 17. <hi>With-hold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if we have the affluence (A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance) of all earthly bleſſings, how ſoon may the Arm of ſtrength be dryed up as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> was, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4. and all things elſe turned and changed in us: Our wiſdom into phrenſie, or folly or bruitiſh madneſſe, Ahitophel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.31, 33. and our beſt perfections turned into defects: ſight into blindneſſe, hearing into deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, memory into forgetfulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> health into ſickneſſe, wealth into want, plenty into ſcarcity, when God doth break the ſtaffe of Bread, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.16. By
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:173117:149"/>either: 1. Preventing us of Bread, Or 2. Changing the vertue of it, and other food, ſo, that we ſhall eat and not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.10. peace into trouble, and life into death: and if all theſe be not ſanctified to us, how ſoon are we made worſe by them, and are the more expoſed to <hi>Satans</hi> ſnares and temptations: Thus for temporal bleſſings, and for ſpiritual Graces and bleſſings how many do we want; and are yet wholly without them, beſides the uſe of them all how requiſite growth of them, and encreaſe daily, how neceſſary? and our perſeverance in them, to crown all with comfort, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of all the means of Salvation, <hi>as to our good,</hi> and <hi>to become a Savour of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life;</hi> All is to be had from God, he only opens the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. He did of <hi>Lydia,</hi> elſe <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. but God only gives the encreaſe. Our Faith is but weak, our Hope but faint, our Obedience imperfect; our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vowes, promiſes, purpoſes, how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable are they? and how apt to change? the woful experience of many ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons when recovered, and many troubled
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:173117:149"/>Conſciences, when comforted, who have revolted from all to ſin again, doth ſpeak too much to this. 5. And our lives, how ſhort, and how momentary.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The very ſhortneſs of our lives which are but for a moment, and our own inability, as of our ſelves, to bring any thing to perfection.</p>
            <p>All theſe do call upon us, and invite us earneſtly to be importunate with God for his help from above to ſtrengthen, and confirm us.</p>
            <p>And ſince our lives are ſo ſhort, to pray and do, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.4, 5. <hi>Lord make me to know mine end, and the meaſure of my days.</hi> Pſalm 90.12. <hi>And teach us to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our days that we may apply our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wiſdom:</hi> and may learn of the Apoſtle to <hi>redeem the time,</hi> becauſe <hi>the days</hi> (of our lives) <hi>are evil,</hi> Epheſ. 5.15.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Friends:</hi> How many elected, are yet uncalled; remaining in darkneſs! How many weaklings are there in the body of Chriſt, that need thy aid in this kind! And how many fainting under the

And as for <hi>Foes,</hi> (whether men or devils) we know they are many, and mighty, and crafty, and cruel, violent and inſolent, aiming at our deſtruction: Therefore we had need to pray. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.19. <hi>Lord conſider mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with cruel hatred: And deliver us not over unto their Will, for they breath out</hi> (nothing but) <hi>cruelty,</hi> Pſalm 27.12..</p>
            <p>And thus in reſpect of our ſelves and others, there will be everlaſting Uſe of this Armour, and that in ſeveral kinds. 1. Prayers or Apprecations for bleſſings. 2. Supplications or Deprecations againſt evils, either felt or feared, that they may be prevented or removed. 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions for others. 4. To all which we muſt add Thanksgiving, in reference to all, as occaſion is offered, and ſucceſs comes in; as they are in part named here in the Text, and all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. In that ſerious
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:173117:150"/>Exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>That firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſsions, and giving of Thanks be made for all men,</hi> &amp;c. You have had reaſons from God, our ſelves, and others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now add a fourth Reaſon, which is the laſt, and which ariſeth from, or is in reſpect of the duty of Prayer in it ſelf, and its excellency in the <hi>Cauſe, End</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Cauſe, viz.</hi> God himſelf: It is the Lord that ſets us on work to the performance of this duty by Precepts and Promiſes: And he only doth effect this in us by his holy Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 17. <hi>Who helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf doth inform, and act us hereunto, and in the duty.</hi> And this is very welcome and acceptable to him, which he prefers before other ſacrifices, and calls for as for Muſick. <hi>Can.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for it is ſweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe are the pleaſant harps and ſweet perfumes which he delights in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8. Here be the golden vials full of Odours or Incenſe; and this muſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:173117:151"/>needs be excellent, which hath ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>End</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Honour and Glory of God: He is ſet up, and magnified in our prayers to him: And in his Anſwers to us: Prayer gives him the honour of his greatneſs, and us the experience of his goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Effects</hi> of Prayer, which are marvellous: There is ſo great an <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,</hi> and ſuch an invincible force in prayer, that it is ſaid of Prayer thus: <hi>Vincit invincibilem, ligat Omnipotentem,</hi> it conquers the invincible, and bindeth the Omnipotent; overcoming him that overcometh all things. Do but mark what God ſaith to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Exod. 32.10. Deut. 9.14. <hi>Let me alone</hi> (or ſuffer me) <hi>that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why, what could</hi> Moſes <hi>do to hinder God, or ſtay his puniſhment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely nothing by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of humane force above divine, but by condeſcending of divine Grace to the deſires of the godly: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24, 25, 26. In <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:173117:151"/>prayer, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. Hence <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.22. Nothing could be done till <hi>Lot</hi> was gone: His preſence and prayers prevent it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Oh how much are the wicked bound to the godly for their company, and the godly to the Lord for his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who ſpares them in ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com calamity, as he did <hi>Noah</hi> before; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>As the new wine is found in the Cluſter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>deſtroy it not for a bleſsing is in it, ſo will I do for my</hi> ſervants ſakes, <hi>that I may not deſtroy them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer</hi> is truly ſtyled <hi>Conſolatio ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, cura dolentium, &amp; Sanitas Aegrote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> a comfort for mourners, the joy of the ſorrowful, and health for the ſick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prayer</hi> hath a faculty of ſingular prevalency: it is like the gift, which is as a precious ſtone, (or a ſtone of grace, <hi>Eben-chen, Lapis gratiae,</hi> Arias Mont. in the eyes of him that hath it, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Giver</hi> or <hi>Receiver</hi>) whether ſoever it turneth, it proſpereth, it maketh room for a man, <hi>i. e.</hi> It gets him favourable audience, and exalts him to honour,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:173117:152"/>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.8. and 18.16. of theſe we have daily experience: and the like we may ſay of Prayer, <hi>It proſpers, it moke room for; and honoureth us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This piece of Armour is of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, and that in the way of Offence and Defence.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Offence:</hi> Of which take a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; by this it was that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> overcame <hi>Amalek,</hi> Exod. 17.10. to 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And <hi>Iſrael</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,</hi> Judg. 6.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By this <hi>David</hi> fruſtrated the Councel of <hi>Achithophel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. and 17.23. (ſo mayeſt thou of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil againſt himſelf) and conquered his enemies often, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.9.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Abijah Jeroboams</hi> mighty Army, 2 Chron. 13. ſo that five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choſen men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſlain, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And <hi>Aſa, Zerah</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> with his Hoſt of a Million, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.9. to the end) and three hundred Chariots.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> the multitude of <hi>Moab</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:173117:152"/>and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and that without a blow ſtrucken, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6, 17. or any fight at all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Hezekiah, Sennacherib,</hi> and his <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. And wicked <hi>Jehohahaz</hi> was reliev. ed by prayer from the cruel oppreſſion of <hi>Hazael</hi> and the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 Kings 13.3.4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> There is no way more ready to ſubdue an enemy, than by <hi>prayer</hi> to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>☞ And without doubt it is as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al againſt ſpiritual as corporal enemies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Devils were caſt out in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.18, 21. 2. And that <hi>Pythoneſs</hi> diſpoſſeſſed by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 10.16, 17, 18. 3. And this piece of Armour, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, is here preſcribed againſt the Wiles, Aſſauls, and violent temptations of the Devil in every kind, ſo that the devil hath no weapon ſo ſharp againſt us, but this is able to break the point, and dull the edge of it, ſo that it ſhall not be able to hurt us.</p>
            <p>And as it is thus Offenſive to an ene
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:173117:153"/>my of what ſort ſoever, ſo it is no leſs defenſive of our ſelves in many reſpects. In the very way of Offence it ſerves for our Defence; For that in the fall of ſuch enemies, when they are brought down, <hi>we riſe and ſtand upright,</hi> Pſalm 20.8.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And in the way of <hi>Defence,</hi> prayer is very prevalent to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Save us from the wrath of God, as in the caſe of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Zoar, <hi>the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deliver us from the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Jacob from the wrath, of God, and inveterate malice of</hi> Eſau, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>And the Children from the furnace.</hi> Dan 3. <hi>Daniel from the Lions den,</hi> Dan. 6. <hi>Jonah from the Whales belley,</hi> Jon. 2. <hi>The Apoſtles from priſon,</hi> Acts 5.18, 19. Peter, Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>when faſt in the ſtocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Supply us in multitudes of Caſes, <hi>viz. Abraham</hi> with a ſon <hi>Iſaac, Daniel</hi> with wiſdom to interpret dreams, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. And a revelation of the future times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. Elijah <hi>with fire to conſume his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> 1 Kings 18.38. <hi>With water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the earth, and change of weather,</hi> Jam.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:173117:153"/>5.17, 18, <hi>And fire to devour them that came to apprehend him,</hi> 2 Kings 1. <hi>Eliſha with the Spirit of</hi> Elijah <hi>doubled upon him</hi> By this Iſaac obtained a Son, <hi>viz.</hi> Jacob, ſo <hi>Rachel</hi> a <hi>Ioſeph, Anna</hi> a <hi>Samuel, Manoah</hi> a <hi>Sampſon, Zacharias</hi> a <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> a ſon for the <hi>Shunamite</hi> woman. M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Emperour, <hi>Rain</hi> for his Army, <hi>per legionem fulminatricem,</hi> Alſted. T. cat, p. 731: And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the repair of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Removal of judgement, as by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> from Iſrael, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. That Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.4, 6. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7, 1, 4, to 7. <hi>From Graſhoppers and fire. Nineveh</hi> from miſery and utter deſtruction, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, <hi>Prayers</hi> have been marvellouſly effectual to the working of wonders and miracles: For by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> ſtopt the Sun in his courſe, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brought the Sun back ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. <hi>Sampſon</hi> had water out of a Jaw-bone to revive his ſpirits when ſpent, <hi>Iudges</hi> 15. to 20. And <hi>Samuel</hi> procured Thunder and Rain in wheat harveſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17, 18. <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> raiſed the dead, <hi>viz.</hi> the widow
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:173117:154"/>of <hi>Zareb,</hi> and the <hi>Shunamites</hi> ſons, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.17, to 24.2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.18. to 38. And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did the like by <hi>Dorcas</hi> and <hi>Eutychus,</hi> Acts 9.36. to 42. And our Saviour himſelf made uſe of this piece of Armour, when he raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> fromd eath, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.11.</p>
            <p>Now if you put all theſe together, and caſt up the ſum, <hi>viz.</hi> Preſervation from Gods wrath, Deliverance from dangers, Supplies of bleſſings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of judgements, and manifold wonders wrought and effected by Prayer. You cannot but ſay that all theſe tend to the Defence, Support, Encouragement and Security from and againſt all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery darts of the devil, and oppoſition of wicked men, and whoſoever it is that doth withſtand our ſouls.</p>
            <p>And will you ſee all theſe fulfilled in one example, then take the inſtance of <hi>Eliſha</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.14, 15. to 19. where for Offence you have an Army ſmitten with blindneſs: And for defence an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and heavenly forces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered for the aid of the good Prophet. In which the before named particulars
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:173117:154"/>of defence do admirably appear, and all do confirm the concluſion of St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 516. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you have had the Reaſons and Arguments of this point, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That true Chriſtians muſt pray to God frequently and fervently to repel ſuch evils, and to obtain ſuch good things as are neceſſary for the ſouls, or bodies of our ſelves or others,</hi> which is founded upon four Pillars, or ſuch a foundation, which (like a three-fold cord, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.12.) is not quickly broken, <hi>viz.</hi> In reſpect of God, our ſelves, others, and the duty of prayer in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I now deſcend to Application, and to improve all in the Uſes.</p>
            <p>Uſe I. The firſt Uſe is of reproof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as neglect this duty; Many are ſo prophane, that they are very like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Atheiſtical</hi> fool, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.1, 4. <hi>They do little leſs than ſay in their hearts, there is no God,</hi> It is no wonder therefore, <hi>That they call not upon the Lord,</hi> as verſ. 4. <hi>For he that cometh to, and calls upon God, muſt believe that he is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Sure
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:173117:155"/>men are ſenſeleſs of their own wants, and Neighbours afflictions, or of him that ſhould help them, or elſe they would never be ſo careleſs in this as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be. Perſonal grievances are many, publick calamities have been abundant, and that both in forreign Countries, and in our own land. How hath the Church and State been endangered, and the whole Nation afflicted and oppreſſed? But where have our Prayers been the while? What help have we contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this way to their relief? Bewail this neglect; Miſeries may be removed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by Prayer; if not, I am ſure, they will be mitigated, ſanctified, and ſweetned by it: and yet which is worſt of all, I fear there are too many, <hi>That ſeldom think or call upon God otherwiſe,</hi> then by <hi>curſing</hi> and <hi>ſwearing,</hi> &amp;c. thereby <hi>blaſpheming that glorious and dreadful, or fearful name of the Lord thy God; at which name all ought to bow and tremble,</hi> Deut. 28.58.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> It is no wonder if to ſuch, all bleſſings <hi>be turned into curſes, their table into a ſnare,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 69.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 109.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:173117:155"/>The Word of God a ſavour of death unto death, and the means of ſalvation, an occaſion of their damnation, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Others there be, who from the decrees, providence, and appointment of God, do argue and diſpute againſt this duty, as in other caſes alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, an holy life,</hi> &amp;c. they do to their own deſtruction; For ſay they, <hi>God hath determined what he will or will not give, to what purpoſe then ſhould we pray?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods ordinary providence and the appointment thereof, do not exclude, but include ſecond cauſes, as the means of their accompliſhment. <hi>It is by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment that we have life,</hi> yet we muſt make uſe of food and raiment. <hi>That the earth is fruitful;</hi> to which there is a concurrence of the <hi>ſtars</hi> influence, the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>moiſture</hi> of diſtilling, and refreſhing <hi>ſhowers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this knitting the firſt and ſecond cauſes together, is ſo indiſſolvable in the appointment of Almighty God, that without them, the effects do not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:173117:156"/>
            <p>So our <hi>Prayers</hi> for Gods bleſſings, though they be no natural <hi>Cauſes</hi> of them, yet they are a means appointed by the Will of God to obtain them: Neither do we pray to alter the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, but to obtain what he hath ordered to be obtained by the prayers of his ſervants.</p>
            <p>He hath decreed the victory, yet the Soldier muſt not caſt off, or run away from his arms: ſo in many other caſes. <hi>Vid.</hi> Alſted. Theol. Cat. <hi>pag.</hi> 727. So in the ſignificationsof Gods <hi>ſecret Will, Precepts</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> are ever conjoyned together: And if the duty commanded be neglected, <hi>the bleſsing promiſed is not obtained;</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, to 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> It hath been the practiſe of the godly, that when they have been moſt certain of obtaining, they were moſt inſtant in praying, <hi>Iſaac had a ſeed</hi> promiſed and renewed, yet he prayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.21. And <hi>Elijah</hi> knew when <hi>rain</hi> would come, nevertheleſs he prayes inſtantly to obtain it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18 42. So muſt we alſo.</p>
            <p>God ſo promiſeth his bleſſings, that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:173117:156"/>he will have them obtained by prayer, that it may not be ſaid of us, as of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here its true, <hi>Spare to ſpeak, and ſpare to ſpeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Others neglect this duty out of Conſcience and ſenſe of their own <hi>vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and unworthineſs, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> dare not preſume.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But ſince God hath ſo honoured us, as to command us, let us not be guilty of unthankfulneſs and diſobedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And we preſent not our prayers in our own righteouſneſs, <hi>but in his great mercies,</hi> Dan. 9.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to this end the Lord hath provided us a Mediator, his own Son Jeſus, in whom he doth accept our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Others are diſcouraged, and omit the duty, becauſe of their <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>coldneſs</hi> in prayer, and want of words to expreſs their deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Qui non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit.</hi> but ſighs &amp; groans are the beſt R hetorick in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. God bears with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:173117:157"/>Soleciſms and Barbariſms: Better break the Rules of Grammer, then of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and his Canon. Weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is better then whole omiſſion. We know not how God may quicken our dull affections: <hi>But we know we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.1. <hi>propitiating for our ſins, and imperfections in prayers,</hi> Rev. 8.3, 4.</p>
            <p>You have heard in the former Uſe the reproof of ſuch as either neglect or argue againſt this practiſe, that out of ſenſe of their own vileneſs, or fear of their weakneſs, are beaten off and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from the performance of this Duty, and ſo reſtrain prayer from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> charged <hi>Iob,</hi> but not truly, <hi>Iob</hi> 15.4. and with-hold from God this Worſhip due unto him. Theſe things lead to a ſecond Uſe of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Uſe II. This ſecond Uſe exhorts us to the conſtant practiſe and performance of this duty: To which we have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precepts, preſidents, promiſes and performances as have been before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the proof of the point, and to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:173117:157"/>put on this piece of Armour, to ſet upon the uſe of this Excellent Gift, and to exerciſe this Grace which ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us. And to this, I hope, I need not urge many Motives to perſwade and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you, as if you were backward, ſince all the Reaſons before named to confirm the Point, do ſufficiently invite us.</p>
            <p>Hence Motives ariſe from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goodneſs, and the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, in covenant with us: and <hi>Ergo, ready to do us good,</hi> were enough, to which you may add this, the neceſſity of prayer, which in reſpect of us is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Simpliciter, &amp; Abſolute</hi>) as a part of divine Worſhip due to God from us, In, and after this preſent Life, for ever, and to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Our own wants and weakneſſe, deficiency and uncertainty of, either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or enjoying corporal, temporal, or earthly, or ſpiritual, ſupernatural, and heavenly Bleſſings and Graces, the good things from above, but only according to the good Will of God, and the meaſure of his gracious Diſpenſation towards us;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:173117:158"/>beſides the manifold fears and feelings of evils, which our ſhort lives are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obvious to, and never free from. Theſe may very well ſend us to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good, the Rock of Ages for our ſupply, ſafety and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Thus the manifold wants, weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, evils and troubles, that we with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have experience of, ſhould be as wings or ſpurs to our devotions: Hence it is ſaid, <hi>precatio ſine Malis, est avis ſine alis (Alſted. Theol. Cat.</hi> p. 728.) We are apt in proſperity to ceaſe our flight, and ſlack our pace in our prayers, till wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſpur'd on by afflictions: or if we conſider others, whether they be Friends, and what need they have of our help this way: Or Foes, and what need we have of help againſt them: Theſe may well put us to ſeek ayd from above to help us, both according to our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The duty of prayer in it ſelf, and the excellency of it in the cauſe, end, and effects.</p>
            <p>It is God that ſets us on work, he is the Author &amp; Efficient cauſe; and Chriſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:173117:158"/>his Son hath taught us, he is our Tutor herein, and the Holy Ghoſt doth enable us in the ſervice, and ſhall we be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent? And if Chriſt himſelf was ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in prayer in the dayes of his fleſh, &amp; did offer up ſo many ſupplications with ſtrong crying &amp; tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7. to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that God his Father was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Fountain of all good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. To obtain of his Father the Fruit and Efficacy of his Miniſtry, <hi>John</hi> 17. For ſtrength to undergo his ſufferings, and to compleat the work of our Redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.41. And that by his Example (as well as Precept) he might animate us hereunto, that ſo we might follow his ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Conſider then, if he did thus, who was moſt holy, had the fulneſs of the Spirit; how much doth it behoove us, that are poor miſerable ſinners, that are deſtitute of all good) but what we have by divine Diſpenſation (to ſupplicate earneſtly at the Throne of Grace for help and ſupply in every kind: And ſince all the moſt Renowned Worthies in all Ages that ever we Read of, <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:173117:159"/>Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. were all fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſervent in this Duty; let us then excite our beſt abilities hereunto: For except we ask as we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. how can we think to obtain bleſſings, either corporal or ſpiritual, earthly or heavenly Mercies, all which are neceſſary for this preſent life, and for a better life which is to come. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we have from the Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the End of our prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>honour and glory of God;</hi> ſure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of all, as Men or Chriſtians, will ſend the Creature to the Creator, the Redeemed to the Redeemer; the ſanctified and ſaved ones of the Lord, to the Sanctifier and Saviour of ſouls, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn (with that Leper) thanks: yea, that <hi>honour, praiſe and glory</hi> which is due for ſo great ſalvation. This is done beſt by our prayers and praiſes. This is the beſt we can do in the way of Requital in our Requeſts to him; in asking and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we do acknowledge, and advance his greatneſſe and goodneſſe; and in our praiſes, his Bounty and Grace, who hath reſpect unto the poverty and neceſſity of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:173117:159"/>his ſervants, doth give us his Spirit to help our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. and doth make us ſharers in the interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, 26. by which we have audience and acceptance to our perſons &amp; prayers, as if both were qualified with full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and as it is God that put us upon this work of prayer, and we in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it do aim at the honour and glory of God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. So if you have Reſpect to the effects of faithful prayers: they do (in a ſenſe) <hi>overcome the invincible God,</hi> and do overſway that power which is unreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as in the caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> with <hi>Eſau</hi> his inveterately hating Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and God had done the like for a filthy <hi>Sodom,</hi> and her polluted Siſters, had they had but ten righteous perſons among them; and Prayer is a piece of Armour of admirable uſe, both in the way of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> and ſubduing our Enemies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporal or ſpiritual: Of which we have many inſtances, and of defence, and that divers wayes: It ſhelters from the wrath of God; it delivers from many
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:173117:160"/>dangers; it ſupplies with bleſſings of ſeveral ſorts in many caſes; it removeth judgements felt or feared; and it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Wonders many times to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spectators and Obſervers. Of all which you have many Examples in Scripture, and all which do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner concenter in the deliverances of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> from the great Army (or huge Hoſt) of the <hi>Syrians:</hi> and the extream fury of King <hi>Jehoram</hi> (the Son of <hi>Ahab</hi>) who ſent a Meſſenger to cut off the Prophets head, becauſe his wickedneſſe and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatry, had provoked God to ſend a great famine upon <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.14, 15. to 19.</p>
            <p>☞ Mark (in this Prophet) <hi>how the Meſſengers of God</hi> are lookt upon and dealt with. If there be any evil Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in a Land or Nation, they are laid in the fault, and muſt bear all the blame as it befell <hi>Elijah</hi> before him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.17, 18. But from both theſe great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Lord delivered <hi>Eliſha,</hi> which are accompanied with many Favors: the <hi>favour of God; freedom from danger; help from Heaven; fers remov'd; Tyranny (of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:173117:160"/>Jehoram)</hi> diſappointed, <hi>v.</hi> 31.32.</p>
            <p>☞ All theſe Motives from God, our ſelves; others: and the duty of prayer in it ſelf, may abundantly ſuffice to put us on, and ſpur us forward to this duty (to which, nevertheleſſe we are ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally backward) and all which I have urged from the Reaſons, though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. So that to the Wonders effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Prayer; I ſhall only add a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Example or two, recorded by the Antients in other Hiſtories: the firſt I ſhall make uſe of, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Army of <hi>Marcus, Aurelius, Antoniinus,</hi> Philoſophers (a great perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of Chriſtians in the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury) was ſo diſtreſſed five dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of water, and otherwiſe in great danger, being encompaſſed with their Enemies. A Preſident of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my acquainted the Anxious Emperor, who was much troubled at theſe things, that there was nothing which Chriſtians could not obtain of God by prayer; and that in the Army there was a Band of Souldiers, all of them Chriſtians. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperor requeſted their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:173117:161"/>which they did ſpeedily perform, and falling down upon their knees, and pouring out their prayers to Chriſt, upon a ſudden a plentiful Rain was ſent from Heaven which abundantly refreſhed the Army. But (on the other ſide) it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their wicked Enemies with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lightning and Hail <hi>(ignis ſpecie &amp; ſimilitudine)</hi> like fire. Upon this their ſucceſſe in prayers the Emperour (much amazed, and aſtoniſhed) did highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Chriſtians, and <hi>(in perpetuam rei memoriam) for an everlaſting memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the ſame,</hi> he called that Legion (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Fulminatricem</hi>) the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Legion; and afterwards he wrote an Epiſtle to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſtrangeneſſe of the thing: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Semel atque ſe Humi abjicerunt, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umque precati ſunt (quem ego ignorabam) Statim &amp; coelo pluvia delapſa eſt, &amp;c.)</hi> As ſoon as the Chriſtians did caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down upon the ground, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>that God</hi> (<hi>whom I know not,</hi> ſaid the Emperour, but am ignorant of) <hi>the rain came down abundantly:</hi> And hereupon he made, and publiſhed Edicts in Favour
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:173117:161"/>of the Chriſtians, <hi>Alsted. Theol. Cat.</hi> p. 731. and <hi>Chronolum,</hi> p. 179. This befell in the ſecond Century. (<hi>Cirum. annum Dui</hi> 170) <hi>Simſ.</hi> pag. 23.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond Hiſtory that I ſhall make uſe of in this kind, Cent. 4. <hi>Circ. An.</hi> 381. <hi>Theodoſius (Magnus)</hi> the Great, who had occaſion to make War twice againſt (<hi>Regicides</hi> ſhall I call them, or) <hi>the Murtherers of good</hi> Emperours. The War <hi>was againſt Maximus the Tyrant,</hi> and <hi>Andragathius</hi> the Captain of his Army, who ſlew <hi>Gratianus</hi> the Emperour; and then (as it is uſual) he uſurped the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> whom having ſubdued the Emperour prevailed againſt him. <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> was juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death; and <hi>Andragathius,</hi> ſeeing no way to eſcape, threw himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into a River, and ſo deſperately ended his wretched (and blood-guilty) Life, <hi>Judas</hi>-like.</p>
            <p>His ſecond War, was againſt thoſe Rebellious Traytors, <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogaſtus,</hi> who had ſtrangled the good Emperour, <hi>Valentinian</hi> the ſecond, lying in his bed. In the beginning of his <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:173117:162"/>againſt them,</hi> the good Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius,</hi> was very hardly put to it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, at the firſt; But <hi>he had recourſe to God by prayer,</hi> prayer all the Night (<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>-like) in which he fought, <hi>magis O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando, quam feriendo,</hi> more by prayer then by any other armed power, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So, that the Lord ſent a mighty tempeſt of Wind, which blew ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently in the Face of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Army, that their Darts were turned back by the violence of the Wind into their own Faces, the Tyrant <hi>Eugenius</hi> fell down before <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to beg pardon, but was ſlain by the Souldiers at the Emperours Feer. Thus judgement without mercy is for them that ſhewed none, <hi>James</hi> 2.13. And <hi>

            <p>☞ <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this miraculous ſupport to the Emperour from above; the Poet <hi>Claudiam</hi> wrote thoſe Verſes, (though no Chriſtian)</p>
            <q>
               <l>O Nimium dilecte Deo cui Militat Aether,</l>
               <l>Et conjourati veniunt ad clasfica venti. <hi>Engliſhed thus:</hi>

               <hi>Ap.</hi> In the end of theſe before-named, and their violent deaths, Obſerve, what may be expected by ſuch: but the uſual End of Traytors, Tyrants and Vſurpers, and what mercy ſhould be ſhewed unto them, more then to thoſe <hi>Husbandmen,</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:173117:163"/>who conſpired together, ſaying, <hi>This is the Heir, come, let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his Inheritance, that ſhall be ours,</hi> and thereby we ſhall be rich, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.1, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.9. <hi>But how long did they</hi> hold and enjoy the Inheritance, and what was the end, and final event of this Conſpiracy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Lord of the Vineyard came,</hi> ere long, <hi>and miſerably deſtroyed thoſe wicked men, and did let out his Vineyard to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This muſt be the End of wicked and Blood-guilty men. Have we had none ſuch in this Nation within theſe twenty Years? and could they think, that it was ſo often written in vain, that the <hi>ſpoylers of others muſt be ſpoyled themſelves,</hi> Eſay 33.1. Eze. 39.10. Habak. 2.8. and <hi>they that take the Sword</hi> (in unjuſt Quarrels, and wit hout a juſt Calling according to the Ordinance of God) <hi>ſhall periſh with the Sword,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.52. yet <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword in a very good Cauſe, one would think. <hi>Cauſes of War</hi> had need to be well examined before Men fight, ſpoyl and kill, elſe there will be a retaliation of ſuch things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.14.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:173117:163"/>God will Recompence men herein, and <hi>with what meaſure men meet to others, it ſhall be meaſured to them again,</hi> Mat. 7.2. For, <hi>he that leadeth into captivity ſhall go into captivity,</hi> or be led by others, he that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with the Sword, muſt be killed with the Sword. In the mean time, here is work for the prayers, the patience, and the Faith of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10.</p>
            <p>☞ Theſe things may encourage us to be unwearied in prayer; For <hi>faith, patience, and prayers,</hi> work wonderfully ſtill, as in former Ages, on the Churches behalf, and have we not lately had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it. For, do we not think, that prayers had not the moſt powerful Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in the great Alteration, who God in much mercy hath made in our Land in <hi>May</hi> laſt, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1660. Yea, and that beſides, and beyond any other mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Force: in reducing the King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, ſo many Years baniſhed, and the Ancient Government of the Kingdom ſo long, and ſo miſerably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and ſpoiled by cruel and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Uſurpers, and that contrary to the curſed intentions of ſo many, and beyond
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:173117:164"/>the very hopes and expectations of all men, in ſo ſtrange a way.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>And why did God do this, but to verifie and juſtifie his manifold promiſes to Kingdomes and Nations, in that caſe ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> All which you may ſum up in that ſhort Sentence of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſa. 34.6. with the variation of one word:</p>
            <p>This poor Nation cryed, and the Lord heard and ſaved, or delivered us out of all our troubles, <hi>Sit Deo &amp; Gloria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have had the Uſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to ſundry perſons, and of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with divers Motives to perſwade us thereto. To theſe I ſhall ſubjoyn ſome Advertiſements, and Directions concerning Prayer, and ſo conclude this Subject, and cloſe up this Text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. You know what prayer is, <hi>viz.</hi> A making known of our Requeſts to God, in every thing by Supplication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conjoyn'd with Thankſgiving, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. And this may be done <hi>Mentally,</hi> or <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> by Ejaculatory Expreſſions, or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Petitions, upon a ſudden, or at a ſet-time: privately or publickly, as the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:173117:164"/>preſent neceſſity, occaſion, or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Affair doth require and will permit.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Who must pray?</hi> I anſwer, All perſons, out of duty to God, the Great Creator and bountifull Benefactor of all things, of men in a ſpecial manner, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. Hypocrites within, and Infidels without the boſome of the Church, all may and muſt pray thus, out of duty, and ſometimes they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſucceſſefully: as <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21.27. Thoſe Marriners in a ſtorm, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. though Heathens, and the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> Jonah 3.8. But the Elect of God pray only effectually, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and of theſe, all that are truly godly, do in a moſt ſpecial manner apply themſelves to this Duty; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beſt knows that this is a Service due to the Lord, who is <hi>Paramount,</hi> the chief Lord, from whom we hold all things; he is acquainted with the duty, and <hi>receives the Spirit of Adoption</hi> to help him therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And he is qualified for it, both in his perſon and Graces.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his perſon, he is not in the ſtate,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:173117:165"/>trade and bondage of ſin, for <hi>God hears not ſuch,</hi> Joh. 9. But he is Righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to ſuch is the promiſe made, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Graces: and that in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, and Affections; In the underſtanding with knowledge, faith to believe, that God <hi>is, and that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. that our perſons are accepted through Chriſt, and that out Suits are welcome to God through him. In the will and affections with a right poſture upon the right Object, <hi>viz.</hi> God, not upon ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101.3. For if we regard iniquity in our hearts, he will not hear us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66.18. Sincerity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, <hi>Bonum ſub Ratione Boni,</hi> Grace, becauſe it is Grace; to ſuch is that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.18. Zeal muſt be in our will and affections, and that in a right proportion. This Sacrifice muſt have ſome Fire, ſuch prayers are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>James</hi> 5. Not if cold, or dead. Theſe and all ſuch perſons ſo qualified, of whatſoever ſex, age, ſtate, or condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may, and muſt pray privately, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne proper ſtation,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:173117:165"/>place and Imployment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for publick prayers in Church, they only muſt perform them which are lawfully, and publickly called to Church-Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, as <hi>Timothy</hi> was by <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. Thus, there may be an intruſion upon publick work, whether <hi>prayer</hi> or <hi>preaching,</hi> or adminiſtring the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. The publick Miniſter is the <hi>mouth of the people</hi> to God in <hi>prayer,</hi> &amp; <hi>of God to the people in preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>To whom must we pray?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To God, He only is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with our holy prayers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. This is an Homage only due to him, God claimes it as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar prerorative, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.15. And the Church acknowledgeth it her dutie to perform it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.1, 2. <hi>Praiſe waiteth for thee, O Lord, and unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> Or to all, or any one perſon in the Trinitie, that <hi>holy Hymn,</hi> Eſa. 6.3. <hi>Vulgo,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is directed to the three Perſons of the Trinitie: to them all, as may appear from <hi>John</hi> 12.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26, 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.4, 5. Or

It is ſafe to pray to one perſon, <hi>ſs. Thin. Incluſive,</hi> not <hi>Excluſive</hi> of the Reſt.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>By whom, or by What means, may we make addreſſe to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Only by Chriſt <hi>the Son of God,</hi> He is <hi>the only Mediator, and in him will the Father be honoured.</hi> Some have many Lords; many Mediators, <hi>viz.</hi> Saints, Angels: but where doth God give them Commiſſion to be Maſters of Requeſts for him? But to the Church there is one <hi>Son,</hi> one <hi>Name,</hi> one <hi>Altar,</hi> &amp; one <hi>High Prieſt</hi> in whoſe Hand alone they offer up all.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Vouching the End of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Obſerve, it is not to acquaint him with what he knows not, or to mind him of any thing forgotten; Or to move him to any mercie, as if he were backward thereto, as if we could prevent him, in forwardneſſe for the Creatures good;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:173117:166"/>But it is to acknowledge out dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and his Soveraigntie; and to make a way or thankfulneſſe, and a holy and right uſe of mercies when received: for if God ſhould beſtow upon us <hi>Non Petita,</hi> we ſhould eaſily aſcribe them to our ſelves, or to chance. <hi>Alſted.</hi> Th. Cat. p. 726.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. For what things muſt we pray?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not for every thing: For every thing will no more bear a Prayer, then every ſtream a ſhip, or every back a weighty burden. But prayer may and muſt be made for all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Lords Prayer, there's their Rule: For whatſoever makes for the glory of God, and for our own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and for all the means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereunto, and only for ſuch things, for ſpiritual good things without condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for temporal with the condition, if God will, and that it be for our good, as that <hi>Leopard</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. if thou wilt.</p>
            <p>For you muſt note, that all the things we pray for, muſt be warranted under ſome precept or promiſe in general,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:173117:167"/>though not expreſly, and be of ſome weight or importance, either in it ſelf, or by circumſtance; But we muſt never pray far any unwarrrntable or any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing, as <hi>Gameſters</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> &amp;c. do. ſuch prayers are abominable, <hi>Alſted. Theol.</hi> Cat. p. 745, 735. Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> p. 142</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Queſt. <hi>For whom muſt we pray?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For all men eſpecially the Elect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All men are our Neighbours, whom we ought to love as our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But the Elect are our brethren, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members of the ſame myſtical body, and one body with us in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> In that prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.11, 22, 23. Chriſt prays for it, and the Apoſtle affirms it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13. Therefore we muſt have chief or ſpecial reſpect to them: <hi>For Charity begins at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we muſt pray for them in the firſt place. Me muſt pray for men of all orders, ranks and degrees whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>high or low, rich or poor, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> For Infidels, Hereticks, exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All Relations are to pray for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually.</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:173117:167"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Miniſters for the whole Church, and ſpecially for the people committed to their charge,</hi> Epheſ. 2.16. to 20. and 3.14. to 20. <hi>And the people for their Miniſters,</hi> as the Church did for St. <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Magiſtrates for their Subjects,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>yea though they be rebellious:</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11. <hi>And Subjects for their Magiſtrates,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Maſters for their Servants, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for their Maſters.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Generally <hi>we muſt pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Jam. 5.16.</p>
            <p>☞ By mutual prayers we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more for the greateſt good one of another, then we can effect by any other means whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Now if it be asked, <hi>Whether it be lawful to pray againſt others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; Prayers of this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:173117:168"/>nature are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> 2. <hi>Imprecatio,</hi> Complaints or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Complaints of the Saints to God: now theſe are then, when in their prayers to God, they do mention the multitude, Malice, the Cruelties, Injuries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations of enemies over them, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> did when ſo railed upon, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.10, 14, to 20. The deſertion of friends, as it befel <hi>David.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Afflictions, and their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and inability to bear and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
            <p>☞ Of theſe the Pſalms, the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and of moſt of the Prophets, are full of examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe are very lawful, and out of queſtion very good, becauſe God only can reſtrain, repel, ſubdue, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, or change the minds of ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as for the <hi>Imprecations</hi> of the Saints, which are made only againſt Gods and the Churches implacable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and which are indeed but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Denunciations, by which the
<pb n="019" facs="tcp:173117:168"/>judgements and puniſhments which ſhall befall ſuch enemies are evidently, and clearly foretold, if they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Such as theſe are uſual in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the form of them is by Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Curſes upon ſuch enemies, as it is manifeſt in them every where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And theſe are, or may by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but with theſe conditions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Imprecations</hi> muſt be only againſt ſuch, as God hath curſed, and that are his Enemies. 2. It muſt be in the cauſe, behalf, and for the ſake of God, and not from any private hatred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge. 3. It muſt be with the condition, that they are incurable, and paſt healing or amendment. 4. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we rejoyce at the deſtruction of them ſimply conſidered as men, but at the vindication of the glory of God, and deliverance of his Church from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>☞ As for the Requeſts of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> againſt themſelves for others ſake, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. You muſt note, That thoſe Prayers are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſimply and abſolutely, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:173117:169"/>if it might be, with Gods good pleaſure, And each of thoſe Wiſhes or Requeſts did ſpring from no common, but from a moſt excellent faith, acting by a ſingular, extraordinary and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Charity, and is not therefore to be drawn into common example.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>How ſhould we pray, and what are the things requiſite to religious prayers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: 1. <hi>Frequenter,</hi> frequent and often: The many Precepts and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God to, and for this, do prove it ſufficiently: And the continual medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>upon Gods promiſes,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15, 16. and 65.24 may &amp; will quicken us hereto, if we have any ſenſe in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Scienter,</hi> with knowledge; and that of God, who is near unto us, and in us: And for what we ought to pray with good warrant, and for whom in charity: only thoſe that ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt are excepted; But theſe are hard to be known.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Attente,</hi> with intention of heart, and ardency of deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe (as I have ſaid) are the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:173117:169"/>only prevalent prayers, as of <hi>Moſes, Elijah, David,</hi> and not with lip-labour. Yea the very Heathens at their ſolemn devotions, did proclaim, <hi>Hoc agite,</hi> do this, to excite intention, and to invite to an united ſtrength in devotions, <hi>Tanquam in celeuſmate,</hi> as Mariners do when they draw the Anchor: And ſhall not we do ſo as they did in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sancte,</hi> in an holy manner: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God muſt be ſought with an holy heart, both for ſpirituals and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. <hi>Not what we, but what he will:</hi> and all earthly things are to be asked and ſought for ſo, as may be ſuitable with his glory and our good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Humiliter,</hi> humbly and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. 1. Out of the ſence of our own miſery and unworthineſs, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>And an earneſt deſire of the grace of God, which is the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> Pſalm 42.1, 2. and 143.6.</p>
            <p>☞ This Humility is wrought in us by a due ſence of Gods properties and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his <hi>Immenſity, Omnipotency, Sanctity,</hi> and the effects of the ſame to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:173117:170"/>us-ward, as he is our Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier; And of our own four-ſold Eſtate. 1. Integrity. 2. Miſery. 3. Grace. 4. Glory. Then let us pray with the prodigal Son, and ſay as he, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.21. <hi>Father, we have ſinned againſt heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Fidenter,</hi> believingly with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>That we ſhall be heard in our prayers,</hi> becauſe of the Truth, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Omnipotency of God, <hi>who is able to ſave to the utmoſt:</hi> And with an acknowledgement that Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediator and Interceſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Hear then the Doctrine of <hi>Papiſts, &amp;c.</hi> concerning the <hi>Doubting of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> reſting upon the Interceſſions of Saints and Angels, and boaſting of their own merits, and the Churches ſtock of works of ſupererrogation: All theſe fall to the ground, as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the Ark of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Obedienter,</hi> obediently, ſubmitting our ſelves to the Will of God without exception, obſerving diligently, what is ſuitable with his mind; what is lawful and permitted to us to ask: And what
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:173117:170"/>he hath promiſed to give. And <hi>Contra,</hi> what is not thus, ſuitable, lawful, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with promiſe: It is intollerable arrogance in man, to <hi>dare in any degree, to ſubject</hi> (or ſubjugate) <hi>the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and will of God to our luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us learn to practiſe what we pray, and to do what we ſay in our prayers. We ſay as Chriſt hath taught us in his prayer, <hi>viz. Hollowed be thy name, Thy kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But do we practiſe it? Do we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, not diſhonour his name, promote and haſten, not hinder his kingdom of grace and glory: Obey, not rebel againſt his Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we do thus, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we pray obediently, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an anſwer accordingly: <hi>&amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Perſeveranter,</hi> perſeveringly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately, <hi>not fainting, or giving over to pray, but perſisting ſtill herein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our Saviour directs us to by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of that unjuſt Judge, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. to 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> prayes, and waits upon God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.1. and 130. <hi>per totum,</hi> till he
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:173117:171"/>was weary with crying, his throat dried, and his very Eyes did fail, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.3. with expectation, and yet he renewed his Suits. <hi>Moſes</hi> was importunate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. and <hi>Jacob</hi> prevailed by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>God in prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> would not be ſtav'd off, nor diſcouraged with Reaſons or Reproaches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.25, 27. The blind man, when check'd, <hi>cryes the more,</hi> Mark 10.48. <hi>Paul prayed thrice, i.e.</hi> often, at laſt obtains ſupport only, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. and thus <hi>ſhould we be inſtant in prayer;</hi> and then we need not doubt, but that we ſhall be prevalent at the laſt.</p>
            <p>But now comes in <hi>Sathans</hi> temptation, and our own corruption appears alſo, and both conjoyn to ſuggeſt ſomething, to make us weary of <hi>praying,</hi> and to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Oh ſaies the weak Soul, <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea and that often,</hi> and <hi>a long time, yet no anſwer comes;</hi> Nor have I obtained what I have ſo often, and ſo long <hi>prayed</hi> for?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a temptation uſual and frequent, and prevalent with many to hinder inſtance in <hi>prayer,</hi> even, for the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:173117:171"/>beſt of bleſſings, and moſt neceſſarie to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why doth God many times defer to hear the <hi>prayers</hi> of his children?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To try them, to exerciſe their Faith; to make them acknowledge the gifts and bleſſings prayed for, to be of God, and not from themſelves; to prize bleſſings the more, when not preſently or eaſily obtain'd. That their hunger and thirſt after Grace might encreaſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that he hears the <hi>prayers</hi> of his people ſeveral wayes: By grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ask according to his Will; by way of exchange, not giving us what we ask, but ſomething that is better; he denies temporal, but gives ſpiritual and Eternal bleſſings; he removes not the Croſſe, the affliction, but gives ſtrength to bear, and by ſuffering, to conquer in the end, as he did to Chriſt in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.42, 43. To <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Why God doth not hear the prayers of men many times?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For many Reaſons: Becauſe we ask amiſſe, <hi>James</hi> 4.2, 3. we ask what God will not give, or what
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:173117:172"/>is not fit for us to receive, like children that ask for poyſon, which the parent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we ask for things good, and uſeful in themſelvs, but may be hurtful to us; as a Child asketh a Knife, but is denied: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we many <hi>times ask coldly &amp; perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily</hi> without that zeal, affection &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion requiſite in <hi>prayer;</hi> but God by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring us, warms &amp; whets us, and fits us to more thankfulneſſe, when we have obtained. We often pray without that due ſubmiſſion, patience &amp; acquieſcence in the good Will and pleaſure of God, which we ſhould have. We often murmure under the Croſſe, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under afflictions. We do not bleſſe God, as <hi>Job</hi> did, in diſtreſs; hence we are not heard, or deliverance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: we are too haſty and do not wait as we ſhould for the Lords fitteſt time to help us, which is only known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God often hears us, <hi>non ad volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, ſed ad ſalutem,</hi> as <hi>Bernard,</hi> not to our Will, but to our Salvation. So to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Jezabels</hi> tyrannie and perſecution requeſted to die, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. This was not granted he deſired,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:173117:172"/>but ſoon after he was tranſlated to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without any death at all, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2: 11. in a glorious manner. The greatneſs and multitude of our ſins, which are not very quickly removed and ſubdued, do often cauſe this. An old Oke is not cut down with one ſtroke of the Axe, nor an exquiſite Image or picture, perfected in one day, but with many Reiterated ſtrokes &amp; cuts, or carvings: So the old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in us, is not ſo ſoon ſlain. Nor the new man, ſo ſoon made up to perfection in us.</p>
            <p>I have done with the ſubſtantials of devout <hi>Prayers.</hi> Now as to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Voyce, Geſture, Place, Time, Formes of prayer</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> briefly</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Voyce,</hi> I ſay, publick <hi>prayer</hi> muſt be Vocal, for the Miniſter is the mouth of the people, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. But private-<hi>prayer</hi> need not be ſo alwayes, as we do ſee in the Examples of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Hannah;</hi> Yet the Voice is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſed to very good purpoſe, even in private <hi>prayers,</hi> though not to advertiſe God of any thing, or before, to whom deſires are manifeſt; Yet to excite our Devotion, as <hi>Austin,</hi> and to conſecrate
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:173117:173"/>our tongues to the praiſe of God, to which purpoſe they were made, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.9. To lend our tongues to the holy Ghoſt in praiſing God, and to reſtrain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our wandring minds. But in all our prayers, let us be ſure that our hearts do lead the way in our Vocal expreſſions and petitions, leaſt that be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſtus, as <hi>Eſiay</hi> 29.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8. For God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Spirit leads us in prayer to God, <hi>Tertullian, Non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat clamor, ſed pectoris intimus ardor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Avoid <hi>Battologie,</hi> which is more for <hi>oſtentation</hi> then <hi>intention of mind;</hi> ſhort prayers are moſt effectual, if from the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Groans, Sighs</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> have their uſe, <hi>Fletus Deus citius audit quam preces;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Geſture of the body in prayer, this hath been very various in the prayers of holy and devout men.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the Scripture confine us by any certain Rule; all Geſture being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified hereunto.</p>
            <p>For we finde ſome kneeling upon

            <p>Yet although there by not a ſet-Rule preſcribed in Scripture for the Geſture, Yet Right Reaſon will teach us to uſe ſuch Grave and Reverend Geſtures as may beſt expreſſe our fear of God, and excite and ſuit with our affections in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes: as to <hi>lift up our Eyes</hi> in hope of Gods mercie, and caſt them down, in <hi>bewailing our ſinnes,</hi> &amp;c. that our Bodies may conform with our Minds. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, let us conjoin with the Church: and in private prayers, uſe ſuch geſtures as the zeal of our ſouls doth ſuggeſt. Such Geſtures, <hi>Quos ardor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi imperat,</hi> Being ever mindful of St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Rule, That <hi>what things are not againſt Faith,</hi> nor good Manners, and <hi>have ſomething</hi> in them conducing to better Life, whereſoever we find them, we do
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:173117:174"/>not only, not diſallow of them, but do commend and imitate them, <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. For <hi>Place</hi> for private prayers: <hi>All places are warranted for private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> John 4.21. 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,</hi> &amp;c. But that place is fitteſt, that is freeſt from diſtraction, &amp; fartheſt from ſuſpition of hypocryſie. For publick prayers, before the Law the Patriarchs found out places, <hi>where they built Altars,</hi> &amp;c. which were for the convenience of the place, or upon ſome ſpecial mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God, <hi>Gen,</hi> 8.20. and 13.18. and 28.16, 17, 18. Under the Law, the Tabernacle, the Temple, both for the Ark of the Covenant, and a Type of the Meſſias, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.48. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10, 11. Beſides they had many Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues for prayer in the cities of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> Under the Goſpel Religion is not bound to a place: For our Saviour pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in the wilderneſs, Mount,</hi> in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Peter <hi>on the houſe top.</hi> Paul <hi>on the ſea ſhore.</hi> The <hi>primitive Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Cemeteries,</hi> under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Emperours, holy Houſes, till driven
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:173117:175"/>out by perſecution, which <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> did demoliſh and deſtroy: Then <hi>ſumptuous Temples</hi> were raiſed in, and after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, by <hi>divers Emperours</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in <hi>After-times,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſuperſtitions crept in; but theſe being purged and removed, we may make uſe of the places, as they did in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> &amp;c.) make uſe of Temples (abuſed to <hi>Idolatry</hi>) when the Idols were caſt out, and the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try purged away: And ſuch places, and <hi>Sumptuous Fabricks</hi> we now make uſe of for Order and Decency, and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; not for the <hi>holineſs of the place,</hi> per ſe, ſed tantum relative, <hi>as it is imployed and uſed in the worſhip and ſervice of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. For <hi>Time: Non adſemper,</hi> Times have turns for ſeveral buſineſs; are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional or ordinary.</p>
            <p>We are not tyed to any one ſet hour for <hi>private prayers.</hi> 1. It is not for us to err with the <hi>Euchytae</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites, that would only pray, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all other Ordinances. He that will do nothing elſe but pray as they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:173117:175"/>did, ſhall pray nothing at all to purpoſe. They might as well conclude, <hi>eating al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> from that place: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.10. where <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Mephiboſheth, He ſhall cat,</hi> &amp;c. as ſo to pray contiinually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor with the worlding, that can find a time for all things, but for Prayer and Devotions can ſpare no time at all: For Prayers as they are, 1. Occaſional. 2. Ordinary, as daily Prayer like the morning and evening ſacrifice of old. 3. Or Extraordinary, in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry times of danger and diſtreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in ſuch caſes eminent men have prayed three times a day, as did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 55.17. and <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 6.10. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is for us, <hi>Non ſegneſcere,</hi> not to be dull and ſlothful, and negligent in prayer. The Ingreſs and Entrance of the morning, our refreſhings at our meals, and the cloſe of the evening, do all invite us to be mindful of this duty of Prayer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, Touching forms of Prayer, you muſt ſtill diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt private and publick.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In private prayer it is impoſſible
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:173117:176"/>for any form to anſwer, and ſuit with every mans particular neceſſity, and every man is left to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Publick; a form of Prayer is very uſeful and convenient, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with antiquity. <hi>Set forms are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Almighty God,</hi> as of Bleſſing, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24, 25, 26. So ſet Pſalms by <hi>David</hi> on ſpecial occaſions; So for Faſts.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour preſcribes his prayer as a Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. And as a form, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. Of all prayers, premeditated are the beſt, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. And of premeditated, thoſe allowed by publick authority, are to be preferred. All Chriſtian Churches in the firſt and beſt times had their ſet forms. And our own Liturgy both ſimply and comparatively is the beſt, penned and allowed of by learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and Martyrs: Yet <hi>Quaedam in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro corpore,</hi> as <hi>Ja. Armachanus,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> adviſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things: and conſider, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by men, it is inferiour to the Scripture; It is not to be reſted upon, as alſufficient to ſalvation; This is to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:173117:176"/>idolize it, and ſo we may abuſe the beſt things, and make them pernicious to our ſelves, that are precious; To reſt to much upon a form, is in in the way to fall.</p>
            <p>And for order, a man may begin his Devotions with Confeſſion, Petition, Thanksgiving, as he ſees cauſe. In all, be we ſure our hearts be right, and that the duty be performed with regular and true devotion of ſoul, ſo ſhall we have acceptance with God, and at laſt obtain eternal ſalvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus of the things leſs Eſſential or Circumſtantial in our Devotions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Voice.</hi> 2. <hi>Geſture.</hi> 3. <hi>Place.</hi> 4. <hi>Time.</hi> 5. <hi>Forms, and order, of Prayers.</hi>

            <p>THE Exhortation of the Text foundeth like the words of an aged, decaying, or dying Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, (<hi>Philem.</hi> 9.) or faithful Preacher of the Goſpel, (chuſe you whether; who having ſpent the courſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:173117:178"/>of his life, in giving light to others, ſo that he may in a proportion aſſume the Motto of a waſted Lamp, Torch or Candle, which is <hi>lucendo pereo,</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faithfully taught people the way to ſalvation, ſhewing them <hi>how they ought to walk,</hi> &amp; pleaſe God, and ſo be happy for ever: at laſt he doth aſſume the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a dying <hi>man,</hi> to <hi>crown all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pains</hi> with a <hi>general precept</hi> of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernment, and which he would have take the deepeſt impreſsion upon them, <hi>viz. That what they had received and learned, that they would retain, be expert in, increaſe in strength, and abound in fruit more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This text may be fitly ſtyled, <hi>The dying Preachers Legacy;</hi> and whether the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher dye ſoon after, or otherwiſe, yet is the Counſel very uſeful for the living, yea for all.</p>
            <p>And in this ſhort Legacy, though <hi>one main thing be aimed at,</hi> viz. <hi>Their increaſing and abounding,</hi> &amp;c. Yet upon the by, you have three things more very obſervable, ſo that the particulars of the Text in this <hi>verſe,</hi> are four. 1. The <hi>Preachers labour</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:173117:178"/>and inceſſant work, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 2. His <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>paſsionate affection</hi> to the people, <hi>viz. as to brethren, and thoſe of neareſt and deareſt relation.</hi> 3. The peoples duty, <hi>viz. In relation to the Preachers pains to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, learn and practiſe ſo,</hi> as to walk as they ought, and to live ſo, that they may pleaſe God. 4. A Chriſtians Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, (which brings him to full matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) <hi>viz. To increaſe inſtrength, and to abound in good fruit more and more.</hi> Theſe are the particulars of this Verſe, and of theſe in order.</p>
            <p>In handling of which, I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Original words,</hi> as we paſs to clear all to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And now as to the firſt, <hi>viz. The Preachers labour.</hi> Thus as the <hi>old, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed Prophet,</hi> (<hi>Hoſea</hi> I mean) is very ſententious, as is evident to the <hi>judicious Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So is our <hi>Apoſtle: Every word hath its weight:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, q.d. <hi>Reliquum ergo,</hi> it remains therefore.</p>
            <p>A man would think that the Apoſtle had ſaid and done enough, yea as much as could be done for their good, yet here
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:173117:179"/>is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Remnant, <hi>Futhermore,</hi> ſomething ſtill to be added to what was done before.</p>
            <p>Doct. I. <hi>A Preachers work is never at an end, his labour is as long as his life:</hi>
               <q>Redit labor actus in orbem.</q> 
               <hi>His motion is circular, and the end of one work enters another.</hi> As it is with the <hi>ſerular,</hi> ſo with the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one buſineſs diſpatcht, makes way for the next: ſomething is ſtill to be done, though people be never ſo well inſtructed and grounded in the truth. St. <hi>Peter</hi> thought ſo: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12, to 16. <hi>He would put them in remembrance, whilest in this Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dogmaticals</hi> muſt have <hi>Exhortationals:</hi> And Doctrines muſt be put on to the life, with ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fwaſions, and for confirmation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſons:</hi> 1. Experience proves this: For who ſees not this, that will ſee at all! 2. The <hi>peacher</hi> feels it, that underſtands his own work. 3. The world ſees it, and knowes it well enough: you need no more proof. What Uſe ſhall we make of it?</p>
            <p>Uſe 1. Of <hi>Information.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:173117:179"/>3. Of <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Endleſs work muſt needs be very great and hard work. It is a Proverb, <hi>A light burden far carried is heavy:</hi> ſure then, <hi>A heavy burden long carried cannot be light:</hi> This needs no proof; and ſuch is the work that we ſpeak of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this work be ſo great, no doubt, ſomething is due for it, ſure <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> at the leaſt, and ſome <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is due from the people: But I ſhall not examine this ſtrictly, becauſe I ſpare you: 1. <hi>Labans</hi> dealing with <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo good a ſervant, was nothing commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.36, to 42. 2. And their carriage (I am ſure) was too bad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Apoſtle, <hi>That accounted him an enemy, becauſe he told them the truth,</hi> Gal. 4.16. They did fulfill that Proverb, <hi>Veritas odium parit.</hi> Only thus much let me ſay,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Prophets, Apostles,</hi> the <hi>worthies</hi> of all Ages, and the truly wiſe men of this age, will tell you by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, That this great <hi>work</hi> and <hi>endleſs labour</hi> of the Miniſtry is little, or not at all <hi>conſidered, valued, regarded,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:173117:180"/>in the world, otherwiſe then with as much neglect, diſdain and reproach as may be, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So that theſe ſore labourers may ſit down with thoſe ſad people, or that ſad Church, and ſay as they, <hi>Our ſoul is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud,</hi> Pſalm 123.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Inſtance. <hi>And ſo was</hi> Paul <hi>rewarded by many Humouriſts of his time,</hi> Acts 13.50. and 16.22, 23. and 21.30, 31. Rom. 3.8. 2 Cor. 10.10. And at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> (Anno 32. <hi>Converſionis</hi>) after above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of his labours and Miniſtry, he was beheaded by <hi>Nero, Anno Chriſti</hi> 67. <hi>Alſted. Chron.</hi> Some of whoſe bloody Off-ſpring did not (long ſince) of late years bear great ſway amongſt us: Let <hi>God have the glory of the abatement of their power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But Lord, though it fare thus with thy Meſſengers amongſt men, yet let thy ſervants be precious in thy ſight, and then ſhall they be glorious, becauſe their judgement is with the Lord, and their work,</hi> (yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward too) <hi>is with their God, and he will be
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:173117:180"/>their ſtrength (for ever)</hi> Iſa. 49.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Oh, when will this ſtate of <hi>England</hi> think this endleſs work worthy of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reward, then 5.10.20.30.40.50. <hi>l.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per annum,</hi> to ſupport the perſon of him that is thus imployed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily depending upon him, with Food, Phyſick, Books, and all other neceſſary proviſions.</p>
            <p>I have briefly diſmiſt the firſt point, and ſo I intend to do by the (ſecond) next; and the ſecond particular is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Love and paſsionate Affection of a Preacher to his people,</hi> which is expreſſed in an Appellation and Obteſtation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Appellation</hi> is, <hi>Adelphoi,</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: a ſtyle of near relation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there ſhould be dear affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Obteſtation</hi> adjoyned is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the two Verbs, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>&amp; obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramus,</hi> And we beſeech you.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Beſeeching</hi> is in an humble way,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:173117:181"/>conjoyn'd with great deſire: So here the Apoſtle doth not command like a King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but doth requeſt and beſeech (or beſeech and exhort) in a moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate and ſupplicant way, as to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And in the perſon by whom he doth thus adjure and beſeech them, it is by the Lord Jeſus; not in his own Name, but in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>by whom they were created, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, elected, and called to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:</hi> And all this he doth to win the more upon the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them the more effectually to their duty.</p>

            <p>Doct. II. <hi>Faithful Preachers of the Goſpel do (and ought to) uſe all the pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and affectionate means that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to win men to grace, and to encreaſe therein, as becomes the ſervants of God; and that not in their own, but in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instance.</hi> For proof of this, you need look no further then our Apoſtle,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:173117:181"/>who was an exquiſit Artiſt in this kind. For how did he inſinuate upon King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts 26.27. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19. <hi>He a ſervant to all men, all things to all men,</hi> Non mentientis aſtu, ſed compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes affectu, <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> not by a ſinful compliance in evil, but a Civil in things indifferent, not againſt a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He yields to their infirmities as if he were in the ſame caſe to ſupport them. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20 <hi>As we have a word of Reconciliation from God, ſo as Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as if God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us,</hi> &amp;c. And yet again, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7, 19, 20. Mark the place, <hi>The Apoſtle was as a nurſing mother, not a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to his hope, crown, glory and joy,</hi> as he ſtyles them; <hi>And as a Mother-nurſe in thoſe reſpects.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Thus alſo did the wiſe (Kingly) Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. He ſought out acceptable words of truth, proverbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea words, which ſhould be as Goads and Nails faſtened by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> Becauſe it is for our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, profit; Credit, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>The fruit of righteouſneſſe is a Tree of life, and he that winneth Souls is wiſe:</hi> That wins them to God, from evil to good, whether by councel or example, or both: the verſe is an Allegory made up of familiar Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, of <hi>a Tree,</hi> yea of <hi>life,</hi> to which he is reſembled, a compariſon drawn from Hunters, Fiſhers and Fowlers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is for the credit of trees to be like that tree, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.3. and thoſe, <hi>Eze.</hi> 47.12. Or that tree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. which did ſo flouriſh, were a ſhadow &amp; ſhelter, and yielded ſo much fruit to many to ſuſtain them: and ſuch an One is he (that righteous man) that winneth Souls, ſuch a Man is ſtiled <hi>a Tree of life,</hi> in alluſion to that <hi>Tree,</hi> Gen. 2.9. and 3.22. becauſe God hath planted them, bleſſed them, and enabled them to do much good to others.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:173117:184"/>when he called his Apoſtles, ſtiles and <hi>makes them fiſhers of men,</hi> Mat. 4.19.

            <p n="3">3. Others, This is the greateſt good we can do for them, <hi>viz.</hi> to win them to God; for this delivers the captives of <hi>Sathan</hi> into the <hi>liberty of the ſons of God,</hi> thats woful, this a joyful and bleſſed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26.

               <hi>Ap.</hi> Should men do ſo by us, we ſhould valew the courteſie; O be perſwaded that he does you the beſt turn, that aimes &amp; endeavours moſt for the good of your Soules.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>meanes uſed,</hi> the more it ſavors of kindneſſer, the more like it is to prevail; Man ſhould be ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to be won with Love, rather then
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:173117:185"/>forced with Rigor, <hi>Facilius ducimur, quam trahemur;</hi> we are more eaſily led, then drawn and enforced when the hearer, (cannot but fee) Love in the lookes of the Teacher, affection in his Face, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in his countenance, and the zeal of his heart in his hearty expreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how can it but enter and pierce the heart, and rend like Nailes faſtened in a ſure place, and make him be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all is ſpoken for his good. Sure where the patient is well perſwaded of the love an skill of his Phyſitian, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is like to have the better working, &amp; the phyſick to be the more prevalent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So it is here, all Councel will do the better, and have the kinder working, if you be but perſwaded of the love and good will of the Teacher, which indeed, is inexpreſſible and unutterable.</p>
            <p>☞For faithfull Paſtors (I am ſure) may proportionably make uſe of that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8. <hi>God is my Record, how greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Jeſus Christ.</hi> A moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate expreſſion, conjoin'd with a ſerious atteſtation of Record of Almighty God
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:173117:186"/>who ſearcheth the heart; and the moſt exquiſite, and Excellent Regulation of true Chriſtian affection, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt. Not a carnal, but a ſpiritual affection, it was for Chriſts ſake, and becauſe they were in him that he loved them ſo well, and it was according to Chriſts, to his mind and his example, in whom are the moſt tender Bowels of affection; and who therein, as in all other Excellencies is the moſt abſolute pattern of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36.</p>
            <p>You have heard the Point, and the proof of it, I do now deſcend to uſe,</p>
            <p>Uſe is of Reproof, and that to both ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Agents and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when they are either too dull, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a wrong courſe: To the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or Hearers, when they are either too hard, or diſaffected with what is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially intended for their good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Agents edge is too dull, when Miniſter or others neglect this duty, and have no reſpect to this winning way. What opportunities have many upon the ſouls of their Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:173117:186"/>and Neighbours, which yet neglected, and how many Miniſters (as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are as careleſſe as <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Gallio</hi> the Deputy, and as ready to ask the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with <hi>Cain, Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> Gen. 4.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> The Countrey rues this, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls loſt by this neglect.</p>
            <p>But if you have a Form of publick worſhip and ſervice of God, if that be performed, is it not enough, and have not Miniſters and people done their dutie ſufficiently? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, and I pray miſtake me not (for I am very apt to be miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſome ſiniſter Eares) I am clearly for a Liturgie, or form of Gods publick worſhip or Service, as ſingularly uſeful to the Order, Unity and Peace of the Church, &amp; a great help to the weak, both Miniſters and others, and a meanes to prevent many inconveniencies which will befall <hi>through the want</hi> of it, as <hi>ſchiſm, faction,</hi> &amp;c. And in this (I am ſure) I have all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, <hi>Greek and Latine, Eaſtern, and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,</hi> and that in the Primitive (the firſt

            <p>Yet in anſwer to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, I would be alwayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with this Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That I would have none Reſt, or Rely upon any form of publick worſhip (deviſed by men) as all-ſufficient, either to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a Miniſters duty, or to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a particular Chriſtians ſoul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For to ſpeak firſt to the latter of theſe; It is impoſſible for any particular form to reach all the neceſſities, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Temptations, wants &amp; Weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Infirmities, Defects and particular Occurrences incident to men. There will ever be occaſion to obſerve that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy cloſet,</hi> &amp;c Chriſt himſelf made uſe of other prayers upon occaſion; He <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all night,</hi> and in ſeveral places, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. Let our Addreſſes to God be ſecret and private: for ſecret ſins and ſorrows of ſoul, and <hi>God that doth hear in ſecret will
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:173117:187"/>reward us openly,</hi> Mat. 6.6.</p>
            <p>☞ In a word, Let not a publick form exclude or extinguiſh our private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor let our private Devotions juſtle out the publick Form, cauſing us to neglect or contemn it, as <hi>Fanaticks</hi> do: Let both go hand in hand: frequent the publick Form devoutly, and uſe private prayers ſeriouſly, and be we thankful to God for his good Spirit, that doth aſſiſt us with Grace, to make uſe of both, as helps to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 As for the former, touching the diſcharge of a Miniſters duty, if that be not ſufficiently done by this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I bluſh to hear any Miniſter talk ſo, nor did I ever think him fit for the Miniſtry that did ſo Publick forms are to be uſed for Order, Unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this is not all (not, <hi>col. Ha. Adam</hi>) of the man or Miniſter.</p>
            <p>☞ For beſides this, we have a word not to be diſpenſed with, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. Hear the word at my mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>great Command,</hi> John 21.13, 16, 17. <hi>Feed my ſheep;</hi> ſerious advice trebled, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Wo unto me,</hi> &amp;c.

A dreadful Charge; it is to omit all other places that enforce this; I could never think that theſe, and ſuch as theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could ever be anſwer'd with the bare obſervation of any Form of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, divine Service, or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> If any of my own profeſſion dare appear before the great Tribunal at that great and terrible Day of the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, I muſt profeſſe to you all I dare not ſo appear, nor durſt I ever be ſo preſumptuous: The good Lord pardon our defects, and ſtrengthen us to his own work, <hi>for who is ſufficient for theſe things,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.16. Thus, if the Agent or Preacher be too dull in his place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now this Reproof is againſt ſuch Preachers as are diverted to a wrong way of winning ſouls: which is, when Miniſters think to prevaile by rigour, ſtorms and continual Thunder, rather then Lenity, the <hi>still voyce,</hi> when God appeared to <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 19.11, to 29. it was not in the <hi>whirl-wind, nor earthquake</hi> nor <hi>Fire,</hi> (which yet were uſeful for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:173117:188"/>paration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but in the <hi>ſtill voyce</hi> which gave Gods direction for the anointing of <hi>Hazael, Jehu</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to revenge Gods Quarrel againſt Idolatry, and to rectifie things ſo far amiſſe. But, though this <hi>ſtill voyce,</hi> be for the moſt part the moſt prevalent, and this mild way of winning Souls be moſt uſual and uſeful; Yet this muſt not exclude the ſharpneſſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of a Preacher upon juſt occaſion; there is a time and place for <hi>Boanerges,</hi> Mar. 3.17. to Thunder; and the Apoſtles <hi>Rod,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. is (as to Children) better then Bread in ſome caſes: Or a <hi>Barnabas</hi> to comfort, the Prophets did ſo of old, they ſpared no perſons, no crimes, <hi>Eze.</hi> 21.25. <hi>You prophane.</hi> And our Saviour took his time to tell the <hi>Jewes, that they were of their Father the Devil,</hi> John 8.44. and the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>fooliſh Galatians,</hi> when they were ſo ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched not to obey the <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Apoſtolical Lenity</hi> doth act more by kind Intreaties, then by rigid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and Miniſters that teach thus, do not ſo much imperiouſly and magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dictate, as miniſterially and friendly Requeſt, by which they do ſooneſt gain upon their Hearers, <hi>Paroeus Olevianus, Acts &amp; Monum Fox,</hi> Vol. 3. p. 146.</p>

            <p>It is Recorded that there was ſuch an auſtere gravity, and ſeverity imprinted in the Countenance and diſcourſe of that Renowned <hi>Martyr,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> even to the terrour of the Spectators: that it was ſometimes wiſhed, that it might have been a little more popular, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; then let Lenity and Gravity be mixt to win the Souls of all.</p>
            <p>☞ And a Teacher muſt take heed of being quarrelſom for <hi>trifles,</hi> &amp; too much ſeeking himſelf, and the like, and muſt ſo behave himſelf, that he may ſay truly with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you:</hi> and the people may aſſent thereunto, having nothing to ſay to the contrary, and then they are like to be ſucceſſeful.

            <p>☞ And is it not a marvellous mercy of God, to make his Meſſengers as hard
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:173117:190"/>as Reſolute in the diſcharge of their duty, and purſuance of that which is good, as the people are in evil. For thus ſaith the Lord to the Prophets, <hi>I have made you as a defenced City, as an Iron-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and brazen walls,</hi> Jer. 1.17, 18. and your Faces ſtrong againſt their Faces, even as an Adamant harder then Flint, againſt their wickedneſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7, 8 9.

            <p n="2">2. The next to be Reproved, are ſuch as are diſaffected when Councel is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prepared, tenderly delivered, and fitly applyed for the peoples good. Many make it their work to pick quarrels, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Meſſage, or the Meſſenger, the matter, or manner of delivery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> its eaſie to find fault.

            <p>I doubt many Preachers and Hearers neglect this, but let it not be ſo with us, let good affections be anſwered with the like, and good counſel with obedience.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you a Preachers, 1. Labour, which is endleſs. And, 2. Love which is unutterable, which Love I have cleared by the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, who, 1. did inſinuate upon King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> 2. And became all things to all men. 3. Did beſeech as an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. 4.

            <pb n="365" facs="tcp:173117:191"/>
            <p>Uſes are of, 1. Reproof to Miniſters if too dull or diverted. And, 2. To Hearers, if too hard or diſaffected to good Counſel.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. Informs us, if ſouls are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, how vain then are they, who ſet ſouls at ſo low a rate, as many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people do their own, and the ſouls of others, as if they were of no value. Miniſters by neglect or ambition to riſe, or <hi>eagerneſs</hi> after many things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet aſide this main thing of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls to God. And people ſcarce care upon what account they looſe their ſouls, if Honour or Profit (how unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever gotten) do but invite them thereunto: <hi>Good God!</hi> How many men of latey ears have hazarded themſelves dangerouſly upon this rock!</p>
            <p>How great is the grief, if the <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can catch nothing,</hi> &amp;c. much more if their induſtry only gain injury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Yet this is the caſe of many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of men. And how fooliſh are they, that can prize <hi>Liberty, Recovery</hi> or <hi>Dignity, &amp;c.</hi> procured and conferred by men, and yet do undervalue theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:173117:192"/>Goſpel-proffers for their ſouls health.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. Exhorts: Prize your Paſtors affections, and add to them by your prayers.</p>
            <p>Uſe 4. Of Conſolation; Where this concurrence is, how good is it! This harmony of affection is happy and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
            <p>You have heard of the <hi>Preachers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> The peoples <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> remains to be ſpoken of. I do now deſcend to the third particular, <hi>viz. The peoples duty:</hi> This duty of the people is in relation to the Preachers work: For a Receiver preſumes a Giver. <hi>Where nothing is given nothing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> The Earth gapes ſtill if the clouds be dry: ſo that in this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peoples duty, you have four particulars. 1. A Giver. 2. A Receiver. 3. A Walk. And, 4. The manner and end of Walking.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Miniſters are the Givers; For you received of us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>The Prieſts lips preſerve knowledge,</hi> Mal. 2.7. <hi>The tongue of the learned gives a word in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:173117:192"/>ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4. We muſt give warning, Counſel, Comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as need is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> When all are Givers, they give nothing, becauſe there are no Receivers: yet our brain-ſick Fanaticks fancy ſuch a thing: Every one is a Teacher, and thinks he knows more then enough: no need of receiving, they are ſo full al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. But I leave theſe to their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to their windy fulneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If we muſt give, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: If our Doctrine drop down like dew or rain, <hi>You as the earth, the tender herbs, and the grown graſs, muſt receive it,</hi> If we be as <hi>Jakeh,</hi> you muſt be as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> Prov. 30, 1. If we as Fountains, or Springs of Water poure out, you muſt be as the fruitful valleys which receive benefit by the ſame. If God by us gives Doctrines to mollifie and fructifie your hard and barren ſouls, it is not for you to remain like the rock, the dry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and barren wilderneſs no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the influence of heaven. If God by us ſet up a light, as a Candle upon a Candle-ſtick to give light to all
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:173117:193"/>that be in the houſe, it is for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and not to wink againſt, but to walk in the light, as Children of the light, till you received the inheritance of the Saints in light.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, yield us this Reſult.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Giving and receiving are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and mutual actions, which reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other,</hi> Se ponunt &amp; tollunt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem. <hi>And Chriſtians muſt take great care in both.</hi> You need no proof of this, for God is the great Giver, and all we are Receivers; All elſe are under him as ſtars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> And for Reaſons for this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the, 1. Giver. 2. End. 3. Gift. and, 4. Danger.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Giver.</hi> Becauſe God by himſelf, his Meſſengers, and Means, gives much, he is indefatigable inexhauſtible.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it not a great affront and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to the Majeſty on high to refuſe to receive him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If Princes confer Honours or Favours upon Subjects, will it be well taken if they refuſe it?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="399" facs="tcp:173117:193"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Oh do not you thus provoke the Lord Almighty: What ſhall the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt give to the loweſt, the beſt to the baſeſt, and worſt of Creatures, the moſt honourable to the moſt deſpicable; and ſhall theſe refuſe? Sure this is madneſs and folly, <hi>and much more to receive what Satan gives,</hi> Mat. 4.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The End of giving, which is our good; this is quite fruſtrated, where is no Receiver to make uſe of it. If the clouds give never ſo much rain to the rocks or deſert, all is loſt, ſo is good Counſel to the obſtinate.</p>
            <p>☞ So the Receiver, if he receive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, if it be not from a lawful Giver that hath power and right to give, it is not ſo properly receiving, as taking, ſtealing, or uſurping. A Thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> takes many things, but who gave them to him: Neither God nor man will ſay to ſuch, <hi>As you have received of us, for we gave you not ſuch things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Many ſuch we have had in this Nation of late: ſo in Spirituals; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny take up new Opinions, ſtrange fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and errours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But neither God
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:173117:194"/>nor good men ever gave them, <hi>But the great Tare-ſower the devil,</hi> Mat. 13.27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> In all they ſin extremely, that fruſtrate God, and gratifie the Devil in receiving his Tares, Bane and Poiſon.</p>
            <p>Thus our good, which is the main end of giving and receiving, is quite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and fruſtrated, if both the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Receiver be not right and good <hi>inſe, &amp; in donis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Gift it ſelf, ſee to that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad: <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above,</hi> James 1.17. A good gift tends to make the Receiver good alſo; and a bad gift to corrupt him, as Bribes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do, which blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righteous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19. There be many gifts of that nature, that ſerve to corrupt and pervert men: But do you receive none ſuch; only let it be ſaid of you as in the Text, <hi>That you have received how you ought to walk, and to pleaſe God;</hi> This is to receive that which tends to your perfection and ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Danger</hi> of not receiving good
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:173117:194"/>gifts from God, when they are proffered and tendered to us; And of receiving Evil from the Devil. This ſin doth ſharpen the diſpleaſure of God againſt us, and doth aggravate his wrath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 24, &amp;c. <hi>When Wiſdom ſhall cry after us for our good, and we ſhall reject her Counſel, this doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to rejoyce at our destruction, and mock when our fear cometh,</hi> Verſ. 26. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>e contra, He that hearkeneth unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms counſel, and receives it, ſhall dwell ſafely, and be quiet from fear of evil,</hi> verſ. 33.</p>
            <p>Note, That refuſing God makes way for the devil to enter and pervert us with his gifts. This not-receiving, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the good Counſel of God, was the great ſin of the old world, and of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of old throughout the old Teſtament, and brought woful miſeries upon them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. And as of the old world and Iſrael, ſo alſo in the New Teſtament for the rejecting of Chriſt, and his word. How are they rejected of God, and become the ſcorn of Nations. Indeed this hath been the ſin of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:173117:195"/>For when was the Word, and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God more ſlighted then in this preſent age, our times? Never.</p>
            <p>Thus you have had the point, and the proof of it; The Reaſons from, 1. The Giver. 2. The End of Giving. 3. The Gift it ſelf. And, 4. The Danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deſcend to Uſe, which is of inſtruction and Lamentation.</p>
            <p>Uſe I. Inſtructs us. Be we very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both in giving and receiving, as the point bids us; this deſerves our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care and heedfulneſs. It is not for us to give a ſtone for bread, a Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for an Egg, or for a fiſh a Serpent, or poiſon inſtead of wholeſome food, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. But to give as God gives. And this caution opens a wide door of Lamentation for very many Givers and Receivers.</p>
            <p>Look but upon two or three things of greateſt concernment.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>publick inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How many ſtrange Doctrines and erroneous opinions (if not blaſphemous abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations) have been vented, and given

And as for the Miniſtry, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> overthrow the <hi>power</hi> of it by <hi>concealing</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a <hi>ſtrange language,</hi> and turning it into a <hi>ſacrificing Prieſt-hood,</hi> and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Legends,</hi> &amp;c. ſo do Separatiſts by a <hi>Jerobams</hi> Prieſt hood, crying down all <hi>Maintenance,</hi> and defaming <hi>Miniſters</hi> with the vileſt names of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, to

How ſad will the account be, when the Teachers can only ſay, <hi>What I taught them out of my own heart, did pleaſe their fancy, and ſuited well with the times,</hi> &amp;c. And the Receivers can only ſay, <hi>Of theſe men I did learn to be unſetled in religion, and by them was rolled from one opinion to another, till I had quite lost the truth,</hi> &amp;c. as many <hi>Quakers</hi> &amp; <hi>Ranters</hi> may truly ſay.

            <p>Beſides, there have been Volumes written by worthy men concerning this Subject, of the Education of youth, yet nevertheleſs all that hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, written or done in this caſe, how great is the neglect of all ſorts of perſons generally in the performance of this good work to poſterity, whereby often times it befalls, that multitudes of youths do receive in their tender yonger years, and contract ſuch habits, as are very difficult to be cured by the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed counſels, reproofs, or corrections that can be given, ſo that oft it becomes their own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Look a little amongſt the ſeveral ranks and degrees of men; even the moſt eminent have been to blame in this. As K. <hi>David</hi> was in the Education of an <hi>Abſolom</hi> &amp; <hi>Adonijah;</hi> His too much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs bred his <hi>grief, and their ſmart in the end;</hi> See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.25. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.6. He was (in all likelihood) affected with their beauty, that he neglected his duty to rebuke them for their faults; and you know what befel them both in the end.</p>
            <p>This alſo was old <hi>Elies</hi> fault, though

            <p>Look upon our <hi>Gentry,</hi> and let them conſider what Education.</p>
            <p>Some they devote to travel, in which for want of a good Tutor or Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer, ſometimes they looſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and perhaps Morality too: See Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s <hi>Quo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Others being bred idle at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ordinary imployments are thought too low, and other things are too high for them to reach. Theſe may ſay,

            <p>As for the Vulgarity, for the moſt part they give ſuch Education, that the Children can only ſay, <hi>I received and learned of my Parents to curſe, and ſmear, and lye, and ſteal,</hi> &amp;c. and to be <hi>Telluris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Moſt men are very apt to make great proviſion for their poſterity, and to leave rich portions of theſe earthly Treaſures and Poſſeſſions to their Children: But how few are ſolicitous to ſee the <hi>Image of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Truth and growth of Grace,</hi> the <hi>power of godlineſs</hi> imprinted, and ſtamped upon, and really ingrafted into their off-ſpring, and poſterity, &amp; thoſe under their Charge, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. who did <hi>travel in birth of them, until,</hi> &amp;c.

               </gap>, as <hi>meer Notions,</hi> vapors and vaniſhing Clouds: and are ready to queſtion whether there be any Reality or durable ſubſtance in them, yea or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Yet <hi>Experience doth instruct</hi> us daily, how changeable and periſhable the portions and poſſeſſions of this world have been, and ſtill are: For, how many
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:173117:199"/>mighty ones, both in place and ſtate, in great dignity and abundance of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of all things, that (you might think) nothing could impair them have been brought down, whileſt mean men (by the bleſſing of God) have been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced (not as many of late were, but) upon good ground and juſt deſert.</p>
            <p>To conclude, When Paſtors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and all others concerned in this way of giving Councel and Inſtruction, Education, and Directions for the right ordering of Life: when all theſe (I ſay) <hi>can give a clear account to</hi> God, that all that they have done, and given in that kind hath been right, and according to Rule, and hath been received and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted accordingly; O how good is it, and comfortable both to Givers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and how bad is it when it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? When Evil hath been given, and Evil received, and the <hi>Evil of eternal miſery is the event of all.</hi> Be we all warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, each man do his duty, and we all ſhall be happy.</p>
            <p>The Paſtors <hi>Labour</hi> &amp; <hi>Love;</hi> have been handled in the two former parts of this
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:173117:199"/>Verſe, we are now upon the third parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: <hi>viz. the peoples duty,</hi> in which are four conſiderable particulars, <hi>viz. a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a receiver, a walk,</hi> and <hi>the manner and end of walking:</hi> I have conjoyn'd the two firſt, (becauſe Relative actions) into one point.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Giving and receiving, are mutual actions,</hi> quae ponunt, &amp; tollunt ſe invicem And Chriſtians, <hi>muſt take great care in both. This was proved by</hi> Reaſons, <hi>drawn from the Giver, end of giving, gift it ſelf, and the danger of not receiving,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> were of <hi>Inſtruction, to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in giving, and receiving for</hi> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in miſ-giving and receiving, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in two Caſes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>publick instruction,</hi> and <hi>exhortation,</hi> which hath marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly miſcarried of late, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, although the Doctrine delivered and given forth to others, be never ſo vain and Erroneous; and the Teacher never ſo inconſiderable or unreaſonable, yet multitudes of people drink in the doctrine of ſuch Teachers (as the thirſty earth doth Rain) how hurtful and bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:173117:200"/>ſoever it be to their poor deluded and dead ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the caſe of <hi>education of Youth,</hi> which is miſerably neglected in theſe our Times, by (almoſt) all degrees, ranks and ſorts of people, of what condition ſoever they be; nevertheleſſe, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Commands of God, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Councel and Advice which is given in this particular Caſe. I ſhall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inſiſt upon this Point in any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or further Inlargements: Only I ſhall pray heartily for the amendment of theſe fore-mentioned Faults, which are of ſo much concernment to Church and Kingdom, and to the right ordering of all publick affairs.</p>
            <p>I do now deſcend to the reſt of the peoples duty, conſiſting in <hi>the walk, and the manner, and end of ſuch walking,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here in, as in the former Point I ſhall conjoyn both theſe particulars into one main point of doctrine for our uſe, which will make the Doctrine full, and Uſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. Touching the <hi>walking</hi> in this Text: you muſt underſtand that <hi>walking</hi> is appliable to God, and man:</p>
            <pb n="413" facs="tcp:173117:200"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To God;</hi> and ſo it notes his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. as in the <hi>Garden,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>providence for good, or evil</hi> towards us, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12, 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To men,</hi> it ſignifies the <hi>motion</hi> of the Body from one place to another: in which is, <hi>terminus à quo, ad quem, &amp; via per quam,</hi> &amp;c. The whole progreſſe of mans Life in matters of Faith and Manners, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Enoch,</hi> Pſalm 119.1. <hi>&amp; pasfim.</hi> And hence obſerve this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Every mans life is a walk, and but a walk, it begins at our Birth, and ends at our Death, and is but ſhort at the longeſt: In every life there are Terms,</hi> viz. <hi>à quo, ad quem, &amp; via per quam:</hi> and theſe terms do differ, <hi>ex Diametro,</hi> are quite croſſe one to another according to the way in which we do walk. For if our way be good, then our Terms are from <hi>Satan</hi> to <hi>God, Sin</hi> to <hi>Grace, Hell</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> But if it be <hi>bad,</hi> then our Termes are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For this <hi>Walk</hi> is appliable to <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> in their ſeveral wayes, and this leads me to take in the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of <hi>thus walking,</hi> viz. ſo as to pleaſe God, for this is the Conſolation,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:173117:201"/>and this will be the perfection of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and this makes the Point full, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjoyned together, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Every mans life is to be ordered ſo, that we may pleaſe God in our generation, and in the courſe of our converſation.</hi> This the Apoſtle prayes earneſtly for, <hi>viz. Thut we may walk worthy of the Lord to all well-pleaſing,</hi> Col. 1.10.</p>
            <p>This all will eaſily grant, that we ſhould all live to pleaſe God, but the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe is not ſo eaſily done, and upon due ſearch we ſhall find, it is a very hard work to live as we ought, and here you may Dicotomize the world: and all the ways &amp; terms of all men walking in the world: all which are either pleaſing or diſpleaſing to Almighty God; and this puts us upon one main Inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould we ſo walk that we may pleaſe God, and wherein doth this walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſt, that we may diſcern: for this being known, we ſhall eaſily ſee who they be that diſpleaſe God, in the courſe of their life and practiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in anſwer to the grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, obſerve, that the diſtinctive Notes
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:173117:201"/>and Characters of ſuch as walk and do pleaſe God, are ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are ſuch as walk with God:</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> did in their Generations, <hi>Cen.</hi> 5.22. and 6.9. And you know how God <hi>tranſlated</hi> the one from Earth to Heaven, ſo that he never ſaw death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and preſerved the other with his whole Family in the general Deluge, when the whole world beſides was drowned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. And all becauſe they had this Teſtimony, <hi>that they pleaſed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And <hi>that walk before</hi> God, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did in their time, in <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and uprightneſſe,</hi> Gen 17.1, 24, 40. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.4. and <hi>David</hi> made uſe of all deliverances to this end, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.12, 13. of his ſoul from death, and feet from falling, that I may walk before God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ Theſe were men that ſo walked with, and before the Lord, that they made a progreſſe (as Travellers do in a Journey) in their holy path: they were neither idle, nor ſtood ſtill, much leſſe were Retrograde, or apt to Retreat: they ran to the Goal, and gained the Garland
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:173117:202"/>of Glory, This <hi>is our duty, God expected it, and if we perform it,</hi> God <hi>will crown it accordingly. Theſe walked not inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>exactly,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rule, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. Not after their own Fancies, Imaginations, inventions, as many ignorant, ſuperſtitious, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Formaliſts and Fanaticks do, to the great danger of their Souls: and theſe men in their walk, way and practice, aimed not ſo much at the applauſe of men, as the approbation and acceptation of Almighty God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked not with the world, but with God, and God took him out of the world, as too good to live in the ſame with ſuch men.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in a moſt unrighteous Age, when the earth was filled with violence (as our Land was of late) the old world did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love him, nor would hearken to him, or Regard his preaching, though for their own good; the reſult of all was, the Lord preſerved him, when the reſt periſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Abraham believed</hi> in God in a moſt
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:173117:202"/>Idolatrous Age, and walked <hi>before</hi> God when others forſook him; the Reſult, God <hi>bleſſed him abundantly,</hi> called him <hi>his Friend,</hi> Jam. 2.23. and gave him the honourable title of <hi>the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> Rom. 4.11, 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>David</hi> was much afflected with the evils of his time, inſomuch, that his <hi>Eyes guſhed out with Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> becauſe men kept not Gods Law, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.136. Theſe Evils he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Repreſſe as he was able, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101. and God gave him the <hi>testimony</hi> of an <hi>upright heart,</hi> 1 King. 9.4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Many others did the like, <hi>Princes, Prophets, Apoſtles:</hi> the care of thoſe men was to pleaſe God. <hi>Had thoſe men learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> ſmooth and ſlick, to temporize hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and concur with the times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſure they might have had the favour of the World in a very high meaſure, for the World will love her own, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. But this they ſought not after, it <hi>was beſides and below them;</hi> and hereupon this Record of Honour lyes upon all their Graves, as well as upon <hi>Enochs, that they pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. &amp; the <hi>reward of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:173117:203"/>is with them,</hi> whereas had they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with, they had periſhed with the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And thoſe men that <hi>walk ſo, with and before</hi> the Lord, as thoſe men, <hi>Enoch,</hi> &amp;c. did, are ſaid ever ſince, <hi>to walk in Gods Lawes</hi> and <hi>Commandements,</hi> in his Judgements, Ordinances, wayes, and Pathes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>&amp; pasſim,</hi> in <hi>the name of the Lord,</hi> Micah 4.5. not only in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion, but in the true Faith and Knowledge, ſincere Worſhip and Service of God. Idolaters walked in the name of their Idols (as Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do) but without any truth of faith or worſhip. <hi>In the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.16. <hi>i.e.</hi> By the directions of the Spirit of God, ſuitable with the holy Scriptures which were dictated by the ſame Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Many in our Times pretend to the Spirit marvellouſly and ſtrangely, <hi>but they lay the Scriptures</hi> aſide; <hi>By this you may know</hi> their Spirit to be a Spirit of Errour, not of God, but a deluſion of the deluſion of the Devil. <hi>In newneſſe of life,</hi> Rom 6.4. Having Received a new life of Regeneration from Chriſt, in whom they
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:173117:203"/>are ingraffed, and now as graffs in the true ſtock do bring forth fruit according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>In good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. which God <hi>hath ordained that we ſhould walk in them;</hi> Here try your works whether good or no: <hi>All is not gold that gliſters,</hi> Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, vain-glory, boaſters, bad ends, are ſuch as ſpoyl our ſeeming good works, as with man, theſe have been, and are too frequent amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe men that ſo walk as</hi> Enoch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did, are alſo ſaid to <hi>walk in the old, in the good way,</hi> Jer. 6.16. <hi>Many pretend to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> but are much miſtaken, as <hi>Papiſts for their Religion,</hi> which indeed <hi>(Statu quo)</hi> Is but an upſtart Sect, a Novel invention. <hi>Many Proteſtants alſo in reſpect</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things which are now accounted old, are much miſtaken alſo. <hi>Many</hi> would have things to be good, becauſe <hi>they be old,</hi> but <hi>except you unite goodneſſe to the oldneſſe,</hi> you ſay nothing. <hi>The old mans hoary head</hi> is a Crown of Glory to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. Yea, but how? if it be found in the way of Righteouſneſſe; but <hi>the old ſinner of an hundred</hi> years old, is accurſed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.20.</p>
            <pb n="420" facs="tcp:173117:204"/>
            <p>☞ It is not ſimply <hi>the oldneſſe,</hi> but the <hi>goodnes of</hi> any thing that doth really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, elſe ſin is <hi>very old,</hi> viz. from our fall in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in the beginning, all <hi>vice</hi> &amp; <hi>violence</hi> is very old, <hi>viz.</hi> from before the <hi>Flood:</hi> the old world was ſick of it, and God was ſick of them for it, and you know what befell them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Capiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſequent.</hi> Yet in <hi>Solomons</hi> ſence, all <hi>vice</hi> is but a new invention, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. But mark his ground, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God <hi>made man righteous,</hi> Gen. 1.27. <hi>Innocency</hi> was firſt, and Chriſt <hi>the antient of dayes</hi> in the <hi>beginning. Sin came</hi> in afterwards, <hi>an egg</hi> of our <hi>own hatching,</hi> Eſay 59.5. So that <hi>Tertullians</hi> Rule is very true, <hi>Quod anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisſimum, eſt verisſimum,</hi> God is <hi>Truth it ſelf,</hi> who is from Eternity, and <hi>innocency is of the Truth,</hi> which was the firſt ſtate of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus every thing, the nearer it is to the <hi>Fountain,</hi> the Original, the <hi>truer it is in its own</hi> Nature.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with <hi>Religion,</hi> the way of our walk of old, that <hi>Religion</hi> which kept cloſeſt to God, his Word and Precept, was beſt, and this the <hi>idolatrous Iſraelites</hi>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:173117:204"/>rejected. So in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> which is neareſt to the Doctrine and practice of Chriſt, his Apoſtles and primitive purity, is the beſt, which <hi>many Chriſtians</hi> do marvellouſly ſwerve from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap. Popiſh additionals,</hi> and <hi>oſtentous ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c. do not add to, but impair, not beautifie, but deform and deface the goodneſſe of true Chriſtian Religion &amp; power; And thus we muſt reaſon with all Papiſts, Idolaters, and ſuperſtitious perſons in the world, whoſe Ceremonies and vanities are meer Novel Inventions, and the very Ground-plot of all their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Fancies and erroneous Opinions that have ſo peſter'd the Church in our times: For ſay they (in effect) <hi>If the</hi> Pope <hi>may propound what Rules he pleaſes, and preſs them as lawes to be inviolably obſerved? why ſaith the Paſtor,</hi> or principal perſon of each particular Aſſembly, may not I do the ſame upon <hi>a better principle</hi> (as they ſpeak) and by the <hi>Dictates</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> though without the Word of God.</p>
            <p>To cloſe this, this <hi>old way</hi> is applyable to divers things, but I have given you Gage enough to judge of <hi>antient things</hi>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:173117:205"/>by their goodneſſe, but not of their <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> by their Antiquity. Chooſe the <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt things</hi> that be the beſt: and as you are wiſe in your Choiſe, ſo ſhall you be happy in the fruition of <hi>old</hi> and excellent <hi>things.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>old way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Now next, ſuch are ſaid to walk <hi>in the way of good Men, in the paths of the Righteous,</hi> Pro. 2.20. Phil. 3.17. <hi>i.e.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt pattern and Preſidents, Men worthily Renowned, and moſt fit to be imitated by others.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did a little while (<hi>viz.</hi> three years) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.17. and ſo long he proſpered, but he ſoon grew weary of it, and then many changes came upon him.

Its univerſal in its cure, not partial to ſome particulars, but it overpowers the whole man, which is acted by this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. <hi>Chriſt becomes our life, then we live the life of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Thus thoſe that walk and pleaſe God,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:173117:209"/>are accepted of him.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond particular, <hi>viz. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering our Relations as to a King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I may not here ſpeak at large,</hi> only conſider, <hi>That whatſoever ſubjection is due to any, is much more due to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus thoſe that walk to pleaſe God, <hi>do walk with and before God,</hi> in the Laws, Name and Spirit of God; in the old and good way, and in the way of good men: In faith, Love circumſpectly, in the Truth, by Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> worthy of their vocation, the Lord in Wiſdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regry.</p>
            <p>And for manner, they walk as you have heard.

            <pb n="429" facs="tcp:173117:209"/>
            <p>But for theſe you may ſee my Notes upon thoſe ſeveral Relations.</p>
            <p>Uſe I. Let it be our Glory to bear the Image of Chriſt, the viſible God, ſince he bears the Image of the inviſible God. <hi>God is to us like the Sun, which is but one; none can behold it in its brightneſs.</hi> All Sublunaries are refreſhed by it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hid from the light thereof. So is God, <hi>Be we then as the fruits to the Sun,</hi> that grow upward, and ripen by it, that ſo we may grow like to Chriſt in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though we cannot in <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Get this Image, preſent your ſelves to his <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Printing-Houſe,</hi> to receive his ſtamp and Character upon you; and when you have it, do not deface, but improve this Image of Chriſt in you daily.</p>
            <p>☞ Motives to walk, <hi>at ſupra,</hi> are from God; <hi>His love and delight is in them, Pſalm</hi> 51.6. <hi>And his promiſes abundantly to them,</hi> Pſ. 84.11. Could we but ſee, and rightly apprehend this, it were enough, beſides the <hi>Liberty, Security, Safety, Peace, and final felicity with Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 3.4.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:173117:210"/>all ſuch are great Motives. And yet the great things God hath done for ſuch as to <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, David, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah, Eliſha, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> Their comfort at death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. conqueſt over <hi>hell</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> They ſtand in the Judgement, and enter into glory.</p>
            <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice for Anſwer to the great Inquiry, how we may know, <hi>when we walk ſo as to pleaſe God:</hi> This being known, we may eaſily diſcern, who they be, that do not pleaſe God in their walk, or courſe of life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as ſet God aſide, ſuch there were in <hi>Davids</hi> time. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 54.3. and 86.14. <hi>They have not ſet God before them,</hi> they may well be called <hi>Strangers, proud,</hi> and <hi>violent perſons;</hi> For they were of a ſtrange condition: and have we not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch, <hi>That ſet not God before them.</hi> Theſe ſay to God, <hi>Depart from us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 21.14, 15. <hi>What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him, and what profit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if we pray to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now is it any marvel that ſuch as theſe, who ſeclude God from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, do run into all manner of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:173117:210"/>
               <hi>and walk contrary to God,</hi> as <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The apprehenſion of Gods preſence would produce better fruits, as you have heard, but this they cannot endure to think of; The thought of Gods preſence, is as the ſhadow of death to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as walk after the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> according to that carnal ſtate of ſin in which we were born, and do order our lives as our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon and evil affections do lead us after our own luſts.</p>
            <p>Note, That the words <hi>Fleſhly, Carnal</hi> and <hi>Senſual</hi> are oppoſed in Scripture to <hi>Spiritual,</hi> becauſe they are ſo led, they look not after the things <hi>that are not ſeen, as Faith doth, and faithful people do,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. But only after the things obvious to ſenſe, <hi>The things of this world, as worldly minded men only do:</hi> Theſe are ſo far from being new Creatures, <hi>and walking in newneſs of life,</hi> that they diſdain to be Changelings, are acted by the old <hi>Adam</hi> in all things, <hi>he hath dominion over them,</hi> and are as ignorant of a new birth, as <hi>Nichodemus</hi> was. <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Who asketh
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:173117:211"/>a ſtrange queſtion,</hi> &amp;c. ſo ſimple was he. And as for the ways of good men, they abhor and ſcorn them, as ways too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſtrict for them to walk in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as <hi>walk</hi> in the way of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the manner of men, <hi>that are not guided by the Spirit of God,</hi> but by their own corrupt reaſon and affection. Now <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are not to walk in the way of the people.</hi> But mark how the Lord warned the Prophet there, to avoid this, <hi>viz. By a ſtrong hand,</hi> i. e. by ſuch a forcible ingeſtion, or motion of his ſpirit, as made a ſtrong impreſſion upon the Prophet to yield obedience, and by ſuch a hand as was able to confirm him in his reſolution, and to ſtrengthen him to effect and perform it, the ſame hand no donbt warned the Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus was the Prophet charged, <hi>Not to walk in the way of the people;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>may any of us follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> Exod. 23.2. <hi>For they that ſin with the multitude ſhall periſh with the multitude, as thoſe of the old world, and the men of</hi> Sodom <hi>did.</hi>

            <p>True it is, Examples have a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon many.
<q>Scilicet in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgus manatant exempla Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. Regis ad exemplu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> totus componitur orbis.</q> And in this caſe the examples of great men are very prevalent. In the Holy Hiſtory, as wel as in others, we read, how people uſually followed the pattern of the Princes, as when <hi>David, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> &amp;c. reigned, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did well, lived godly, but when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> forſook the Law of the Lord; <hi>All Iſrael went with him,</hi> 2 Cro. 12.1. and when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> advanced Idolatry, <hi>He cauſed all Iſrael to ſin,</hi> 1 Kin. 14. which is fourteen times repeated to his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infamy: The very natural infirmities of Princes have been imitated, a Mole, Wart, Wen, or Wry-neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much more their moral qualities, whether good or bad: the Drunken, Gor-bellied Emperours made the whole Empire ſo. <hi>England</hi> hath had experience of theſe things: for how did the people follow after in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s times. To do as the moſt do, is the ſafeſt courſe
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:173117:212"/>with many, though not the beſt: This is a great, yet uſual diſeaſe in theſe times. Thoſe that imitate the greateſt, and run along with the moſt, think themſelves ſafeſt, and paſt peradventure for any danger. That Principle of ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of this Nation of old, <hi>Factus ſum ex ſalice, non ex quercu,</hi> whom <hi>Powlet</hi> Martyr of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Mill. p. 969. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appliable to multitudes of this time. They wear Religion as many do their Apparrel, to turn, and ſhift, and lay aſide, as they think beſt for their own ſecurity and advancement in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But how ſafe this courſe is in the ſight of God, and how pleaſing to him, I leave to all wiſe men to judge: Had the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs done ſo, they had never bee renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to After-Ages, as they are.</p>
            <p>Religion is no longer Religion, then whileſt it doth bind us to God, and to his Rule, not to mens example. The diſpenſation is general; It is better to obey God then man, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19.5.29. if it once come to the point: If Gods Laws and mens croſs one another, its
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:173117:212"/>no Queſtion in that caſe, who is to be obeyed: As our King (whom God long preſerve) hath excellently expreſſed in his Declaration: A <hi>Matchleſs piece.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>For the Rule of your Religion,</hi> pitch upon the Holy Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as you heard worthily of late (on <hi>Tueſday</hi> by Mr. <hi>Dingly</hi> of <hi>Haſeley.</hi>) And for examples, pitch upon the beſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the unparalled pattern of all others: and many Renowned Men there are which are Imitators of him; and do you follow them, as they follow Chriſt, as the Apoſtle perſwades, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. You muſt not ask (and then depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Pope or Emperor, the <hi>Civil State</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiastical,</hi> what Religion you ſhould be of; The <hi>Turks</hi> depend moſt upon the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> upon the <hi>Pope;</hi> yet both far wide of the way to <hi>pleaſe God.</hi> It is not what the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> ſay ſimply, but you muſt enquire of the Oracles of God, by which all Kings and Kingdoms, &amp; all the Churches in the world, are to be framed, ordered and governed, and ſo follow them.</p>

Jer. 13.10. <hi>To walk in lyes,</hi> Jer. 23.14. <hi>In pride,</hi> Dan. 4.37. Iſa. 3.16. <hi>After the eyes,</hi> Job 31.7. <hi>viz. To covet others goods. After vanity,</hi> Jer. 2.5. <hi>(i.e.) Idols, which are Devils, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And after ungodly luſts,</hi> Jude 18. <hi>The corrupt motions of the fleſh.</hi> In all which, <hi>They walk after things that profit not,</hi> Jer. 2.8. For Idols, and Vanity, and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:173117:214"/>Sin can never do us any good; no real laſting benefit can be had or got by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus many men do follow their own imaginations and fantaſies, walk in their own ways, counſels and devices: They love to do what they liſt, without controul of any; and they make Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, Security, Lyes and Covetouſneſs, Pride and Haughtineſs, Luxury and Wantonneſs like to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.37. Or <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Dames; of whom you may read at large, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16. to 25. <hi>Who did walk in pride,</hi> ut locis citat. Yea they make Vanity and Wickedneſs to be their conſtant practiſe, their daily delight; <hi>Never conſidering that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of our own hearts, are only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. <hi>And though our own ways ſeem right unto our ſelves, yet the end thereof are the ways of death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. and 16.25. And though many mens vices which are their walk, their courſe and conſtant practiſe may ſeem very pleaſurable or profitable for a time, and as uſeful as an eye or an hand: yet when they conſider, that this eye muſt be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:173117:214"/>out, and this hand cut off, and that for all they muſt come to Judgement: they will then finde all theſe to be but bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the latter end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, do eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us (by way of Uſe) how many are the wayes that do diſpleaſe God, and how few the perſons are that do ſo walk as to pleaſe God: For <hi>theſe things do reach all the wicked in the world,</hi> whom (for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſake) you may divide into four ſorts: <hi>viz. Atheiſts, Senſualiſts, Timiſts,</hi> or <hi>Temporizers,</hi> Men-pleaſers and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> I mean all ſuch as follow their own Fancies, devices and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations in the Service of God, and ſet the Rule (of the Word) aſide.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Atheiſts, men without God in the world,</hi> or ſuch as carry, and behave themſelves as if there were no God, and of theſe are three ſorts: <hi>viz. In thought, word, work.</hi>

Wherein, as in many things elſe; they have <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript</hi> many profeſſed Chriſtians, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate Blaſphemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, though he doth not (or dare not) abſolutely deny a God, ye he doth deny the <hi>providence</hi> of God, and his care of men, <hi>That he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of just,</hi> and unjuſt, and this is in <hi>effect</hi> to deny the Being of a God; and this is the worſt and moſt dangerous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm.</hi> Such an one was <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:173117:215"/>ſuch are (it may be feared) too many Chriſtians, yea, and ſuch Chriſtians as make great ſhew of Holineſſe, and have the Name of God much in their mouths, but it is for their own worldly Ends, the favour of Men, and to bring their own ambitious deſignes to paſſe; there being no better expedient Engine or ſurer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the Atchievement of <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends,</hi> then <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and <hi>palliated ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity:</hi> ſuch were the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 23.14. (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. to 6.) And all thoſe who had only <hi>a form of godlineſſe,</hi> &amp; have we had none ſuch in our Times? let all wiſe men judge, Many ſuch Atheiſts (no doubt) have been, and are ſtill, and theſe men proceed on this Atheiſm, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They <hi>will not ſeck after God,</hi> i.e. in the way and duties of true Religion, and by a due conſideration of the end of our Being: Our Qualification with a Rational and immortal Soul, and of our particular Actions, to what end they do conduce, and of what is true and real Happineſſe, and what is deceitful, and Imaginary. Sure theſe things would make us ſeek after God in a right way.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:173117:216"/>Not as our fooliſh <hi>Seekers</hi> (of theſe times do) who yet are carryed about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of Doctrine, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. Ever ſeeking, but can never find the Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. They are not juſtified by this place, though poſſibly, they may pervert this, as they doe other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their owne induration and deſtruction, as many the like before them have done, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. But as they will not ſeek after God, nor ſerve him, ſo he is not in all their <hi>thoughts,</hi> but againſt their wills they ſet him aſide, and affect not the apprehenſion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. They think God forgets all, as they do that which is beſt, and that he either cannot, or will not ſee what they do. Hence it comes to paſſe that they do contemn God, they make no more of <hi>God</hi> then of an Idol, and grow to that height of Atheiſm, that they deny his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, his Juſtice, and ſay, <hi>he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe are the ſteps, by which the Atheiſt doth aſcend to the height of wickedneſſe, and deſcend to the depth of Hell. And thus a prophane neglect of
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:173117:216"/>God, and mean thoughts of him, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contempt, both of God himſelf, &amp; of his Judgments in their conceits: ſo that they make but a <hi>tuſh</hi> (or <hi>piſh</hi>) at any thing you ſpeake of him, as if he were juſt like our ſelves, of little or no account, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.22. But how God will require for ſuch things, ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They are Atheiſts <hi>in word,</hi> who queſtion and quarrel at Gods providence as they did; <hi>Job</hi> 21.14, 15. How doth God know through the Cloud? and what profit or advantage will it be to us if we delight our ſelves in God? Sure nothing at all, ſay they. Theſe are four times mentioned in that <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and ſix times in the <hi>pſalmes,</hi> viz. <hi>pſalm</hi> 10.4, 11, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No doubt but that we ſhould avoid their wicked practice, for they ſay, <hi>who doth hear, who doth ſee us?</hi> as if God had no regard of any thing here below: yea they ſtick not to ſay, <hi>The Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hears, nor ſees, nor provides for any, but hath forſaken the Earth,</hi> Ezek. 8.12. therefore they contemn and ſpeak <hi>againſt him,</hi> Pſalm 73.8, 9. Thus much of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>word.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="444" facs="tcp:173117:217"/>
            <p n="3">3. Now touching Atheiſts <hi>in work:</hi> How many are there who in their lives and converſation, do live as if there were no God; and are therefore ſaid, to deny God that is above: as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of wickedneſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 31.28. <hi>I ſhould have denyed,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> and though ſuch may profeſſe that they know God, yet (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in works they deny him,</hi> being abominable &amp; diſobedient, <hi>and to every good work Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> Tit. 1.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now if we do ſtrictly examine our ſelves about theſe things: Alaſs (for grief) how many are there that do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain mean thoughts of God, and do ſpeak of him too ſlightly, if not Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly, yea, and do deny him in their practice inſolently and impudently. If we do conſider aright of theſe things, we have much cauſe of lamentation, and who is it that hath not cauſe to Repent, Reform, and keep a ſtrict Watch over his own heart in this particular caſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Atheiſts <hi>in heart, word, and works:</hi> of which the world is too full, and this Age too much inclinable to.</p>
            <pb n="445" facs="tcp:173117:217"/>
            <p n="2">2. The next are <hi>Senſualiſts,</hi> ſuch who live ſo as their Sences lead them, and walk by <hi>Sence,</hi> and not by <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſaid <hi>to live after the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 6, 12, 13. to which Death is annexed, and <hi>not to the Spirit,</hi> Jude 19. They are meerly Animal, and Natural, and Bruitiſh, without any true holineſſe in them, or part in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. and their ſenſual wiſdom which is not from the Spirit of Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. is alſo ſaid <hi>to be Earthly and Deviliſh,</hi> James 3.15. For they <hi>mind only earthly things, their God is their belly, their glory is in their ſhame, and their end deſtruction,</hi> Phil. 3.19. which the Devil doth aim at with his utmoſt wiſdom, and they by this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do effect.</p>
            <p>If you would have a more particular view of theſe Senſualiſts in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice, then do you peruſe theſe enſuing Scriptures, in which ſee an exact deſcription of them, <hi>Job</hi> 21.7, to 16. <hi>Men that live are mighty, and proſperous, and abuſe all,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 73.3. to 12. <hi>That are proud, violent, and talk highly,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 6.3. to 7. <hi>That put away the evil day,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:173117:218"/>mind their beds and bellies,</hi> which you may briefly ſum up thus: <hi>viz.</hi> They are men accompliſhed with all earthly Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, have Health and Wealth, Honour and Power, and what not: they abuſe all to luxury and vanity, are all for mirth and pleaſure whileſt God is ſet aſide, and his Service contemned; and becauſe they have no afflictions they are proud and violent, and talk highly and loftily againſt Heaven and Earth, they care for none, hereupon <hi>they put the evil day far from them</hi> with thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.27, 28. For they <hi>have made a covenant with Death, and with hell are they at Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſo that no harm can come nigh them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.14, 15. They ſcorn the Meſſage of God and his Meſſengers, and make Lies their Refuge, the power and purity of Religion is the Object of their Deriſion: the Affliction of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the troubles of the Church are a non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to them, as to <hi>Haman</hi> of old, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3.15. But all this while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not what's coming, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are going to the Grave, and how ſoon they know not, in a moment. The word
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:173117:218"/>
               <hi>(Sheol)</hi> ſignifies alſo Hell and miſery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee the Annot. that interim, thay ſtand in ſlippery places (as men upon Ice) and ſome caſt down into deſtruction, <hi>&amp;c: Pſalm</hi> 37.17, 18, 19, 20. That an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Scourge ſhall diſanul their League with Death and Hell, and they ſhall be trodden down, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.18, 19. and the captivity (even of Hell) is upon them, for the evil day to them is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and at hand, and the effect of every Viſion, and the Word of the Lord ſhall be done, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. to the End: then ſhall they feel the truth of that Word which they believed not.</p>
            <p>Should we apply theſe things to our Times: Alas, how many (eſpecially of our Gentry and wealthier ſort) do live thus, as meer <hi>Senſualiſts,</hi> men given up to pleaſures, as if they were born to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, then to <hi>jovialize</hi> and <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonize, to eat, and drink, and play in the World,</hi> like <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the <hi>Ocean,</hi> Pſalm 104.26. to ſpend their time in <hi>ſleep</hi> and <hi>idleneſſe,</hi> being altogether unprofitable to any good work, until they dye and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and fall into utter perdition and

If <hi>Jeroboam</hi> will ſet up (Calf) Idolatry, he ſhall have flattering <hi>fools</hi> enough, who (to pleaſe him) will promote his deſign, and run with the ſtream of the time. If <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> ſeem to favour the Chriſtians, many others will do ſo; but if he Apoſtatize as he did, and become a helliſh &amp; Deviliſh perſecutor of what before he profeſſed, all run after to curry favour with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on Chriſt, did not confeſſe him

            <p>
               <hi>This walk of a Chriſtian,</hi> is his whole Life, and the End of his Life is to pleaſe God.

            <p>Doct. <hi>A Chriſtians life is to be ordered ſo that he may pleaſe God. This is every mans work in his Generation and Converſation.</hi>

            <p>Theſe being known, you may eaſily diſcern and know who they be that do not pleaſe God in their way of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as ſet not God before them, but ſet him aſide from their way. Such as walk after the fleſh, and follow their ſenſual Luſts. Such as walk in the way of the people, the men of the World ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. Such as walk after their own devices and imaginations. Theſe four
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:173117:221"/>things do anſwer the Queſtion, who do not pleaſe God: and theſe do reach all the wicked of the World, whom you may divide into four Ranks: <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts Senſualiſts, Timiſts, Fanaticks.</hi> Of the three firſt hath been ſpoken. I do now deſcend to the fourth ſort of perſons that do not pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> the Word is but lately taken up amongſt us, and made of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, and (I believe) not very well underſtood by every one. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explain it to you, for we muſt break the Ice before we can drink the Water, and break open the ſhell, before we can eat of the Kernel. This being done, we ſhall the better diſcern, how that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (<hi>Conveniunt Rebus Nomina ſaepe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>) Names do ſuit with the nature of the things to which they are deſigned.</p>
            <p>The Name <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> was firſt uſed be Heathens, and by them in a better, and in a worſer ſence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a good Sence and honeſt eſteem with them: the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did apply it to thoſe (<hi>Qui in fanis ſacra curabant,</hi> &amp;c.) who did attend the holy Services in
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:173117:221"/>their Temples, and did frequent their Churches and conſecrated places, to conſult the Heathen gods, and to receive Anſwers from them touching their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: and in this better ſence ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were called <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. Afterwards, the ſame Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to be uſed for <hi>Inſanus, furioſus;</hi> which ſignifies Witleſſe, and Furious, and accordingly it was applyed to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were beſides themſelves, that were Rapt, Raviſhed, or inſpired with ſome Fury, poſſeſſed with a Spirit; Or to ſuch as were Fooliſh, Mad, or Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. And this change of the uſe of the Word began upon this occaſion: The <hi>Sybels,</hi> or <hi>Bellonas</hi> Prieſts, who were called and indignitated by that Name, <hi>In the time of their predictions,</hi> and propheſyings, and performances of their Devotions and holy Services, did uſe to turn about their heads, to diſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and toſſe their Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (like <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams</hi>)
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:173117:222"/>with many other ſtrange poſtures and geſtures, Erantick like, to cut, lance and wound their Armes and ſhoulders, that they might ſacrifice their Blood to their beloved Goddeſſe, juſt like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.28. Or thoſe <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi> or <hi>Samaritans</hi> that are ſaid to have Devils: Or thoſe ſuperſtitious Romiſh <hi>Flagellants,</hi> that have learned of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and do act the ſame things: For they are the Apiſh imitators of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Jewes, ancient Hereticks in their holy Services: to conform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now from theſe ſtrange poſtures, geſtures and actings in their Devotions, it is manifeſt, why the word <hi>Eanatick</hi> was firſt uſed for a frantick perſon, <hi>Fanaticus inſanus dicitur, quoniam Sacerdotes, cùm Reſponſa dabant furore pleni inſanire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debantur (prout) &amp; hinc patet quare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticus pro infano dici caeperit:</hi> Thus one deſcribes him.</p>
            <p>Another deſcribes him thus: <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Numine Afflatus, Bacchabundus</hi> (Hadr. Jun.) one raging ripe with a Fury.</p>
            <p>A third thus: <hi>Fanatum quod in Fanis conſulentes oraculum Sacerdotes Laureum

            <p>Hence it befel, that by reaſon of ſuch ſtrange behaviour of the men thus inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and poſſeſſed with this Fury and Rage, this humour was accounted as well a Diſeaſe as an Errour. <hi>Ap.</hi> So that as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of old, and the <hi>Romans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did avoid and abominate the <hi>Leproſie, Scab, Morphew,</hi> and other the like deforming diſeaſes, which infect, deface and hurt the skin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So did the Antients fly from, and avoid this <hi>Fanatick</hi> diſeaſe or errour, and from thoſe that were taken with it, <hi>

And for that it was a <hi>Diſeaſe, Errour</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> inflicted upon them, whom God was very angry with, and marvellouſly diſpleaſed, or elſe, who had greatly offended or wronged Almighty God

            <p>Thus the name <hi>Fanatick</hi> was firſt uſed by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in ſeveral ſenſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In good ſenſe to them that were more ſerious in the ſervice of God. 2.

            </p>
            <pb n="458" facs="tcp:173117:224"/>
            <p>The Worſhip or Worſhippers of God: The firſt ſoberly and ſeriouſly, and theſe bear the name in the beſt ſenſe. The ſecond madly and furiouſly, and theſe gave the word the worſer ſenſe, even among them; for which you have a full Jewry of witneſſes, of Poets, Orators, Comedians, Tragedians, Hiſtorians, and Etymologiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome of them of great antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> of above 1800. years ſtanding: From them the name is transferred to Chriſtians; by whom it is uſed only in the worſer ſenſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them, who are ſomewhat wild Worſhippers; (we have better words for better Worſhippers) and the name name doth fix moſt and ſooneſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who do act ſomething like heathens in their divine worſhip and ſervice, leaving the Oracles of God, and learning to their own fancies and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or other inſpirations.</p>
            <p>The Authors for the proof of theſe things are cited by <hi>Mat. Mart. Cicero</hi> and <hi>Livius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Explanation of the the word <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and this being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,

But, 2. <hi>Affirmatively:</hi> By <hi>Fanatick</hi> I do mean thoſe perſons, who (ſetting the Rule of Gods Holy Word aſide) do follow their own fancies, the devices and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own heads and hearts in the ſervice, viſions and inſpirations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a new rule beſides the Word of God. And here you may take a view of all the Will-worſhip and Worſhippers in the world, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> All theſe follow their own <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and periſh for <hi>want</hi> of a Rule: But I leave theſe to be pitied moſt: See <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>This God regarded not, ſo as to deſtroy them preſently.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. To come nearer; if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Hiſtory, and take a view of the <hi>Jews, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c. None could pretend to more devotion then they did; <hi>Their Alms, Prayers, Faſtings, Phylacteries</hi> and <hi>Borders of their garments, all ſpecious;</hi> yet our Saviour tells them, <hi>That they had rejected the Commandment of God, and made his Word of none effect, that they might keep their own Traditions.</hi> See Mat. 15.1, 2, to 10. Mark 7.1, 2, 3, to 14.</p>
            <p>Here was a great <hi>deal</hi> of <hi>verbal</hi> and <hi>ſeeming Sanctity</hi> amongſt theſe men, but the <hi>main was wanting,</hi> the Life and power of Godlineſs, in as little ſet by or eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſo our Saviour told them plainly: but this was <hi>ſtrange Doctrine</hi> to them, and they regarded it not: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Though he the Son and Heir were ſent unto them, who taught as having authority, who ſpake as never man ſpake, and did what none ever did or could do;</hi> yet this Chriſt could never gain credit with the <hi>Priests,</hi> &amp;c. but ever and anon, they are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:173117:226"/>with him about the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> according to their Rule, and the neglect of their own Traditions. And in the end they violently perſecuted and put him to death.</p>
            <p>Thus they <hi>crucified the Heir and Prince of Life,</hi> Acts 3.15. For which how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is the Judgement of God upon them till this day!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Come we nearer home yet, and look we next amongſt Chriſtians, and ſee if we have no <hi>Fanaticks</hi> here, as well as amongſt <hi>Pagans, Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews, Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſees:</hi> And here (I preſume) thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> profeſſion will claim the firſt place, as the moſt numerous and unanimous Chriſtians: And the firſt (of theſe <hi>Western</hi> parts) converted to the Chriſtian Faith: yet, with their leave or without it, <hi>England</hi> received the Chriſtian <hi>Faith</hi> ſome years before them, whileſt <hi>Rome</hi> remained Heathen; of which we have a ſeven-fold teſtimony of very good credit and Authority, and better then ſuch as they uſually produce to us in like caſes: Nevertheleſs we ſhall eaſily grant them, what they would
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:173117:226"/>have, ſo that they will but grant us a reaſonable demand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For we yield, that they were a very famous Church when the Apoſtle wrote unto them, and teſtifies of them, <hi>That their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the world,</hi> Rom. 1.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Demand is only this to them, <hi>Let them but reduce their Church to the ſame ſtate of Doctrine, Faith and Life which then they had when the Apoſtle wrote and ſo teſtified of them, and the contention betwixt us is at an end, all is well:</hi> But now that they have ſwarved from the Rule, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Apoſtles praiſe, and loſt the faith: But they will ſay, <hi>When did we looſe the faith, ſwarve from the rule,</hi> &amp;c. I retort and ask, when did every gray hair begin with an antient head, and every infirmity with an aged man? When did all the flowers, fruits or weeds in a field appear in one day? When did the Stars all appear in an inſtant, or your own ſins to your ſelves in a moment? Things of this Nature appear in time and ſucceſſion, ſo have their errours done: yet to anſwer directly, we are
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:173117:227"/>not ignorant, when their Principal, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities befel them, the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> with many Acts before and ſince, fay enough to this: but I wave this at preſent: only this much let me ſay, <hi>He is no ſtudied Scholler, that is not acquainted with the grounds of an unreconcilable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt us and Rome:</hi> See Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus let old <hi>Rome</hi> take the Glory of Religion as of old, but now <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> as it is a Religion made up only of <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>antient Hereſies,</hi> they are become more then the <hi>parallel</hi> of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whom yet they do much reſemble in many things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. None pretend to more piety and devotion, and to the honour of Chriſt, then they: None perform leſs, or do more diſhonour Chriſt, then they.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reject the Commandment of God, to obſerve the Popes Decretals: <hi>What he ſaith muſt be good, though againſt the expreſs Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were very quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome about their Ceremonies and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſervations: ſo are theſe to the height.</p>
            <pb n="465" facs="tcp:173117:227"/>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>And this leads me to the next ſort of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> viz. <hi>Separatiſts.</hi>

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:173117:232"/>and <hi>Enthuſiaſms</hi> (with Papiſts and others that do ſo) and generally, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tenets about <hi>Tythes, Relations,</hi> (as <hi>Husband and Wives</hi> divorces, &amp;c. <hi>Chriſts worſhip, Church-covenants,</hi> and <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. of which I have obſerved about the Number of twenty particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> All which are the fruits of their own devices, and after the imagination of their own heart, without warrant and Authority from the Word of God (as hath been excellently diſcovered by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned and worthy Pons) which doth juſtly intitle them to be <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Atheists:</hi> Theſe are they that fill up the Number, and do bring up the Rear. Theſe are ſuch as have ſet God aſide and do reject his Word; and in Scripture-phraſe, are ſaid (with the reſt) to walk after their owne devices, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of their own hearts, and in their own wayes: Now that which fixes this Title upon them is this: Look what the <hi>Conceit,</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> the <hi>Viſion, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Enthuſiaſme</hi> of any of the reſt is
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:173117:232"/>to them, the ſame is this mans inbred-Corruption, and <hi>Sathans</hi> ſuggeſtion to him: they ſay, that they muſt do that which the Spirit doth ſuggeſt to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So ſaith this man, That which his own Spirit, or <hi>Sathan</hi> the evil Spirit ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth to him, that he will do, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon it, and nothing ſhall divert him from it. Tell him the Word of God is againſt him, and that his wayes do tend to deſtruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he will bid you depart from him, he cares not for the knowledge of thoſe wayes, <hi>Job</hi> 21. He will quickly anſwer you, and perhaps deſperately as they did the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>That as they had done formerly, ſo they would do ſtill;</hi> and as for the Word of the Lord in his mouth, they would not <hi>hearken</hi> to it, nor <hi>obey</hi> it, nor be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> by him, but they would perſiſt in their own Courſes, and let come what would; And you may ſoon know what did come, and that did coſt them dear, becauſe they would take no warning: Thus deſperately do theſe Atheiſts ruſh on to Deſtruction, whom I do therefore ſtile <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> becauſe they do reject the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:173117:233"/>Word of God, the moſt infallible Rule of Life, and are wholly ſteered and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the devices, inventions, and evil imaginations of their own wicked heads and hearts to <hi>avarice,</hi> how hainous or hurtfull ſoever before God, and to men.</p>
            <p>Thus have I opened to you the word <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and applyed it to whom it doth moſt properly appertain, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Pagans, Turks, Jewes, Papiſts, Formaliſts, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Atheiſts:</hi> Of all which (for they differ much in degres and Qualities.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Pagan</hi> is moſt to be pittied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Turk</hi> is to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jew</hi> is long ſince rejected of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. for <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (the Papacy) the Lord ſhall <hi>conſume it with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy it with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his coming,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.8, 9.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the <hi>Formaliſt</hi> add to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality the true <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> and <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſſe,</hi> the Life of Religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And the <hi>Separatiſt, abate</hi> of his ſelf-conceitedneſſe and Cenſoriouſneſſe, and get an humble, peaceable and charitable Spirit.</p>
            <pb n="477" facs="tcp:173117:233"/>
            <p>☞ So both theſe may be reduced to the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>good way,</hi> which (like Vertue) is ſeated in the middeſt betwixt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams on either hand, to which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth not, but remains like <hi>Mount Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or the Rock which is unmoveable, on which it is founded, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 125.1.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As for the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> there is no hope of him untill he be converted, which (if in Mercy) it do ever befall him, he will reject with indignation his own devices, and wholly ſubmit to the Dictates of Gods Holy Spirit, manifeſted in the Word of God.</p>

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:173117:234"/>of their owne, and many other mens ſouls, who will rejoyce to behold this good, and pleaſant proſpect (or thing) <hi>that Brethren do well together in Unity,</hi> Pſal. 133.1, Endeavouring <hi>to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of peace,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles grounds, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. to 7.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that nevertheleſſe all that hath been ſpoken, yet as in the great and terrible time of perſecution in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabels</hi> time, God had <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of ſeven thouſand in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who had not bowed their knees to</hi> Baal, nor kiſſed him with their mouthes, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.18.

            <p n="3">III. I could give you in a long <hi>Albe,</hi> or Record, of many eminent Biſhops, Paſtors and Doctors of the Church, that

            <p>And I could preſent you with a black Roll of Biſhops, that were ready for the <hi>black Rod</hi> of divine indignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>acted by Abaddon</hi> the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the enemy of Mankind, to the ruine and deſtruction of the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God, as much as in them did lye.</p>
            <p>I know perſonal Faults are ill tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Offices; yet good Offices ſuffer for ſuch ill managers of them. I am well acquainted with the Name, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and practice of Biſhops, both Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically

            <p>Thus the <hi>Church in general,</hi> this <hi>Church and Nation</hi> in particular have had Kings and Princes. Noblemen and Stateſmen, Biſhops and Doctors, that have been <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaria mundi,</hi> Lights of the World, Stars of the greateſt Magnitude; Men moſt excellent and famous in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages and Generations, that were no <hi>Fanaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. But no man can name, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the multitude of thoſe faithfull and powerfull Paſtors and Preachers, of whom there is moſt uſe, and by whom the Church receives the greateſt benefit; for moſt buſineſſe is done by the light of leſſer candles, whilſt Torches &amp; greater Lights are only for Feſtivals, and Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and Times of more Solemnity then others. Neither can any man

            <p>You know the parts of this Text, which are four, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Preachers Labour. 2. His Love. 3. The Peoples Duty. And, 4. A Chriſtians Excellency.</p>
            <p>From the firſt three particulars, you have had four Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Preachers work is endleſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Love to the people is patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, uſing all moſt affectionate ways and means to win men to God.</p>

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:173117:242"/>cannot be) and Ghriſtians muſt be very cautious and careful in both, <hi>viz.</hi> What they give, and what they receive.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Chriſtians life is to be ordered ſo, <hi>That he may pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two points you had from the third particular, <hi>viz.</hi> The peoples duty in theſe words, <hi>viz. That as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us, how ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God;</hi> The particulars of theſe points may be further and more largely epitomiſed.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the fourth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of this Text, which contains the <hi>Excellency of a Chriſtian,</hi> and is the main drift and aim of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. That they would abound more and more;</hi> and indeed this is the end and aim of the Preachers labour and Love, and of your hearing, receiving, and learning of us <hi>how to walk, and to pleaſe God:</hi> All tend to this main end, <hi>That</hi> (as you have learned to be Chriſtians, and to walk accordingly, ſo) <hi>you ſhould increaſe in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, excell in ſtrength, and abound in good fruit more and more,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth ſignifie and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:173117:242"/>import ſo much; for no <hi>Tree</hi> can abound with fruit more and more, except it have ſtature and ſtrength to ſupport, and produce the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now in the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>you</hi> (as you are Chriſtians) <hi>are the Trees, Grace is the ſap, your chriſtian converſation is the good fruit, in which you are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, excell, and abound more and more,</hi> q.d. <hi>Tou have learned of us to become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, you have received Grace to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let your practife expreſs what fruit you are to produce, and that in great abundance; then you are right.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, and rightly underſtood, afford us this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Excellency of a Chriſtian doth appear in his converſation, in his increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and abounding in good; the more he doth increaſe in ſtature after the likeneſs of the image of Chriſt, the more ſtrength he doth gain in the habits of Grace; and the more he doth abound in good works, which is the fruit of his hearing and learning of his growth, and ſtrength in the habits of grace, the more excellent he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="496" facs="tcp:173117:243"/>
            <p>Thus you have in this point the main drift of the Apoſtle, and of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of the Goſpel. And in this point you have the Acts, Object and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Acts are increaſing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding; the word ſignifies both; for the ſame word here tranſlated to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> is in the tenth verſe next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tranſlated to <hi>Increaſe more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Object, that which is good, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, and the fruits thereof: <hi>Grace</hi> both habitual and actual: For as we are to increaſe in the habits of true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Grace, ſo are we to abound in the Acts, Works and good Fruits of thoſe bleſſed Seeds, and Habits of Grace in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reſult of both is, That this is the Excellency of a Chriſtian, <hi>viz. To be strong in the habits, and rich in the good works of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth import alſo, which is tranſlated to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. And to <hi>Excel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.12. For as he that groweth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:173117:243"/>doth exceed another man in ſtature: So he that multiplieth and aboundeth, doth excel another in good works, the Acts and Fruits of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus the point remains firm; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That a Chriſtians increaſing in grace, and abounding in good, is his Excellency as well as his Duty:</hi> True it is, that he is bound hereto; And as true it is, that he is bleſſed herein; this is the <hi>Apex</hi> of his Excellency, the <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> of perfection, and concludes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Glory in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now for the clearing of this ſo weighty a point, I ſhould uſe this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, <hi>viz.</hi> To give you in ſome Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-proofs to confirm it. Inſtances and Examples further to illuſtrate it. Arguments and Reaſons to ſtrengthen it. A view of the Grace, which you are to increaſe in. And alſo of thoſe good works, in which you are to abound. And then deſcend to Application, which afford us ſeveral Uſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Reprehenſion, Exhortation, Examination and Conſolation.</p>
            <pb n="498" facs="tcp:173117:244"/>
            <p>Uſe I. Informs us, how wanting we be in performing good works; how wicked we be in producing and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing ſo much evil, as provokes the curſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Uſe II. Of reproof to men of all ages, babes, old and young, for that having ſo much means, they continue ſo weak, ſick and wicked as they do, and produce no better fruit.</p>
            <p>Uſe III. Exhorts men of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Authority, and all men to labour for proficiency, which to effect, prune and lop off ſuperfluities which hinder growth and fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Idleneſs, Pride, Worldlineſs, Cuſtome of ſmaller ſins, and ill company. Make uſe of ſuch things as further Increaſe and Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Induſtry, Humility, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mindedneſs, Conſcience of all duty, and Gods Society; All which are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Antidotes againſt Dwarfiſhneſs and Barrenneſs; and then provide for growth and fruit thus: Get the Spirit, and let the Vine-dreſſers be diligent: Make uſe of Ordinances and Means, Exerciſe your Graces, and uſe good company.</p>
            <pb n="499" facs="tcp:173117:244"/>
            <p>Uſe IV. Of Examination, teacheth us to try whether we Increaſe or not.</p>
            <p>Uſe V. Of Comfort.</p>
            <p>But alas! When can all this be done? Not in a moment, or in one hour, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> ſo that I am at a ſtand what to do, the acceptance of me, and my labours of late, and the manifold exceptions againſt both, (my ſickneſs and weakneſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered nor pitied) have put me almoſt upon the reſolution of the Prophet. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.8, 9. <hi>viz. To preach no more, for as he, ſo have I been rewarded,</hi> &amp;c. But that I have a glorious God and Father in heaven that deſign'd me to this work from my birth, a gracious Redeemer that doth command me often to feed his Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. A bleſſed Spirit that doth encourage and ſtrengthen me hereunto; That many Souls are to be edified and inſtructed; I have a Conſcience to be diſcharged, as in the ſight of God: A great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be anſwered and cleared; And a Soul to be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus: And but that the Word of God is as a fire burning in my heart with zeal
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:173117:245"/>for his glory, and the good of ſouls, I had been utterly diſcouraged long ſince in our confuſed times. But a neceſſity is upon me, <hi>yea woe is to me if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.16. Therefore with the Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.19. <hi>I will not, nor I cannot hold my peace for Sions ſake, for your ſouls ſake, till your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs appear in brightneſs, and that you do grow on to perfection in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> Therefore though aged and weak, I ſhall reſolve with aged St. <hi>Peter,</hi> not to be negligent to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the things that concern your ſalvation, though you know them and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Now to purſue our premiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Method, I hope I need not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many particular proofs: For the whole Scripture aims at this, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to grace, and to the fruits thereof, by many Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Yet to give you in a few for many, St. <hi>Peter</hi> layes a ſtrict charge upon us for the root. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Beware of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But grow in grace,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:173117:245"/>
               <hi>Auxanete</hi> implies Motion and Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Growth and Increaſe, a progreſs to a fulneſs and abundance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the fruit, our Apoſtle is as ſerious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Be ye ſtedfast,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Always abounding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And for both the Apoſtle tells us, That this is the main end of the work of the Miniſtry, and the manifold gifts of God upon men, <hi>viz. For the edifying of the body of Chriſt unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 13, 14. <hi>That we be not children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the Head Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and may receive increaſe of the body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in love,</hi> Epheſ. 4.12, to 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And anſwerable hereunto are our Apoſtles inceſſant prayers for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſsians,</hi> Col. 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>That they might be filled with the knowledge of Gods will, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual understanding, that they might walk worthy of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in the knowledge of God, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with all might by his glorious power,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:173117:246"/>unto all patience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs:</hi> And this is a paſſing from ſtrength to ſtrength, fath to faith, and from glory to glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſalm 84.7. <hi>i, e.</hi> Never weary, but encreaſing in ſtrength and courage till they came to <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> to Gods Houſe; ſo doth the Chriſtian, till Heaven. From <hi>Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. Not to ſeveral kinds of Faith, but from one degree of <hi>faith</hi> to another, till it do attain its full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in Life Eternal. From <hi>glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>i.e.</hi> From glory begun upon Earth by Grace, to glory conſummated, and perfected in the glory of Heaven; Thus much for Scripture proof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall add a few inſtances of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, proficients &amp; non-proficients, men of ſtature and Dwarfs, fruitful and barren.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt ſort: Chriſt is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable preſident, and moſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent pattern in this; for he <hi>encreaſed in wiſdom and ſtature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.5, 2. For <hi>stature,</hi> he encreaſed by little and little,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:173117:246"/>as Children do, and that <hi>Lege humanae naturae,</hi> by the courſe of Nature, <hi>Enthymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> And for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> although the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Godhead did dwell in him bodily,</hi> Col. 1.19. and that God gave <hi>him the Spirit beyond meaſure,</hi> John 3.34. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſſumed a reaſonable Soul as well as an humane Body, the <hi>Deity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to united was ſo vailed, that the graces thereof diſcovered themſelves by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degrees, according to the nature of his humane Faculties: ſo he is ſaid <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> And <hi>he encreaſed</hi> in Wiſdome Experimentally; for though he was a Son, yet <hi>learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> Heb. 5.8.</p>
            <p>☞ As <hi>God,</hi> he was abſolutely <hi>perfect,</hi> and needed no encreaſe: but as Man, conſiſting of an humane Body and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul, and as a man obvious to ſufferings, he is ſaid to encreaſe in <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſtature,</hi> &amp;c. But this firſt is an inſtance beyond Example, a Preſident that admits no parallel, incomparable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Come we to a ſecond, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects more upon us,<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> that were here exhorted to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:173117:247"/>how are they commended, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3, 4. in that the Apoſtle <hi>gives thanks to God for them,</hi> that their Faith grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and that their Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other abounded; ſo that the Apoſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did glory in them, in the Churches of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh how well were it, if all people would give their Teachers cauſe thus to glory; but theſe Examples are Rare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Their faith encreaſed,</hi> in regard of the Object, when they apprehended more profound Myſteries of faith then before. Subject: When more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Myſteries apprehended, and that we give a more full Aſſent unto them without any ſtaggerings, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Charity encreaſeth,</hi> either inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, by our more fervent affection to God, and to our Brethren; Or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, by doing good to more and more, and more abounding in works of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> And this encreaſe of Faith and Charity, is a ſure Argument of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in both, and of our proficiency in Chriſtianity.</p>
            <pb n="505" facs="tcp:173117:247"/>
            <p n="3">3. I need not multiply more inſtances of this firſt ſort: For <hi>Solomon</hi> long ſince hath ſtated the caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mang, Chacam, Vejoſeph, Lekach,</hi> A wiſe man will hear, and will encreaſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>But fools (Evilim) deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction.</hi> In which words, <hi>Solomon</hi> doth ſtamp this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as an exact Character upon the head of a wiſe man, that he will improve himſelf in good, as here: and that all ſuch, and only ſuch are truly wiſe. Whereas (<hi>E contra</hi>) thoſe that neglects this courſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes to be <hi>(Evilim) ſimple, ſtubborn, ſelf-conceited, and incorrigible fools,</hi> for ſo the Word ſignifies. And thus we have as many inſtances of good proficients in Grace, as there be wiſe men in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But now to inſtance on the other ſide, of them that be non-proficients, Dwarfs in ſtature, and barren of good: <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old is a moſt ſad Example; for what abundant meanes did God uſe of old, to bring them to this, <hi>viz.</hi> but to <hi>learn how to walk,</hi> and to pleaſe God, and to abound therein, and how croſly did
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:173117:248"/>they move againſt all, and grew worſe &amp; worſe. God gave them Oracles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, his Word and Rod, Prophets, his Meſſengers in abundance, whoſe paines and induſtry was indefategable, never wearied, yet ſtill they went backward, and to do good they had no knowledge: They deſpiſed the Word, mocked and miſuſed the Meſſengers of God, until his wrath aroſe againſt them: and then, as they had turned off him, and all the means afforded, ſo he turned off them, and brought Enemies upon them, that did ruine and deſtroy them without mercy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. to 21. They <hi>perſiſted in all manner of evil,</hi> and ſtuck not to ſay, <hi>that they were delivered to do all thoſe abominations</hi> before-mentioned: and yet thought the formality of this, that <hi>they were the Temple of the Lord,</hi> &amp; muſt bear off all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.3, 4. to 11.</p>
            <p>Yet more, Nevertheleſs, of the means offorded them to make them better, they became worſe then <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> and Idolatrous <hi>Samaria,</hi> Ezek. 16.49, 50. whoſe ſins were <hi>pride, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, idleneſſe, uncharitableneſse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſſe,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:173117:248"/>uncleanneſse.</hi> This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> Condition: they were very evil profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in good, nevertheleſs the great means afforded them to the contrary. But hath <hi>Iſrael</hi> no fellows? I am ſorry to ſay it: yet I muſt ſay the Truth, I fear <hi>England</hi> is too near a parallel with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in theſe things: <hi>We</hi> (as they) <hi>have had Oracles,</hi> yea and Miracles too of late, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Return of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Word of God hath been continued to us all this while; though the Rod of God (the worſt of Rods, <hi>viz.</hi> A civil War) hath been upon us almoſt 20. Yeares, yet how bruitiſh doth <hi>England</hi> in general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, even as they, deſpiſing the Word of God, miſ-uſing his Meſſengers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16, to 21. till wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look among all ſorts, of all Ranks and Qualities: How much more piety and peaceableneſſe, humility and charity, temperance and ſobriety, ſelf-denial and heavenly-mindedneſs, ſhall you find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Nobility and Gentry then heretofore; Nay, are they not more prophane and contentious, proud and uncharitable (not to ſay cruel) yea as
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:173117:249"/>intemperate, and licentious, or deboiſht; more ſelf-ſeeking, and earthly, minded then ever? as if no future or further fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity were to be expected in another Life. Is not this in effect to ſay as they, <hi>We were ſure delivered to do all theſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi> Jer. 7.10. Were not the ſins of <hi>Sodom, pride, intemperance, idleneſſe, uncharitableneſſe, prophaneneſſe, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable uncleanneſs,</hi> Ezek. 16.49, 50. and is there no ſuch thing to be found in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> It were happy if there were no ſuch thing to be found with us, among them of Eminent Rank and Quality. But, as they bare off all with the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So ours with a little formality in the profeſſion of Religion, think to ſcape free from the blame of Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though they be as many, and as bad as theirs, mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 8, 9, 10, <hi>ult.</hi> who did <hi>ſteal, murther, commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> &amp;c. But to leave our firſt Rank, amongſt whom many of theſe things are too frequent and familiar.</p>
            <p>Come we to the Clergy (as they are commonly called) or Miniſtry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="509" facs="tcp:173117:249"/>which have ſuffered much theſe times, and for the Stars of the firſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude (as they eſteem themſelves) our Biſhops: Tell me, how much leſs <hi>pride</hi> and Lordlineſs, neglect, or diſdain of their Brethren (that are of the ſame profeſſion with themſelves) ſhall you finde, then formerly? Or, how much more meekneſs and humility, care and compliancy with their Brethren for the Churches common good, and Well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all things in the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, and Rule of his Word, then formerly? And for other Miniſters in particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, How many can you finde, that are more diligent in their duty, more ſtudious of the good of ſouls, more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and gentle, kind and loving to their people, that by all means they may gain ſome more fouls to God then before?</p>
            <p>And for the Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> They have ſmarted ſharply, and have ſeen the face and fruit of confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet how few ſhall you find, leſs factious and ſeditious, or more pious and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, friendly or neighbourly in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:173117:250"/>Converſation with others then heretofore.</p>
            <p>Oh how well were it with us all, if the Word and Rod had ſo kindly wrought upon us, that we had learned to know the day of our viſitation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.44. That it be not with us, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the point, <hi>viz.</hi> That increaſing in grace, and abounding in good, is a Chriſtians Excellency as well as duty: This is the drift of all the Scripture, the whole Word of God, and this is the main end of all the gifts, and works of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>For this you have had ſome Scripture proofs to confirm it, and ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the further illuſtration of the ſame.</p>
            <p>I do now deſcend to the Arguments and Reaſons to ſtrengthen it, which is drawn from God, the perſon in whom this Grace and growth is, proficiency in it ſelf; Grace in it ſelf, and the event or effect of this growth and fruit, Increaſe and Abundance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God, this is the end of all his huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:173117:250"/>coſt and care of us, for whether he do <hi>plant</hi> or <hi>prune, plow</hi> or <hi>ſow, weed</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> feed or phyſick us, as <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> do as occaſion ſerves, all is to this end, that we encreaſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in good, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Milk, Meat and Medicine, are all for the health and growth of the Child, and if we be fruitfull we ſhall receive a bleſſing with that Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. which <hi>bringeth forth meet fruits,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in their way, will be at great care and coſt to compaſs their owne ends, whether ambitious, covetous, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they be worſe by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. They may teach us induſtry in better things, but none will be at paines for nothing, no fruit, no ſucceſs, no good, real, or appearing and ſeeming ſo.</p>
            <p>☞ The event will be, that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Land, and Fig-tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe that are fruitfull in evil, who like that Earth, bring forth Bryers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is nigh unto curſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 6.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perſon in whom this <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> is: This encreaſe becomes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, with him that is a truly graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:173117:251"/>Chriſtian, ſo that he cannot do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; As healthfull Children (being ſupplyed with Neceſſaries) cannot but grow. As wicked men encreaſe in ſin, and grow worſe and worſe, becauſe ſin is con-natural to them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So the gracious man is better and better, becauſe Grace is become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural with him by which he is become <hi>Nadibh,</hi> a Free and voluntary mover as natural movers are: For as the <hi>ſtone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,</hi> moves ſwifter near the Centre; And the <hi>Sun aſcending</hi> to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> the Noon-point gives more and more light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.8. And the <hi>Rivers flowing</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sea,</hi> (their proper Centre) do encreaſe more and more, as thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47, 3, 4, 5. ſo <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>ſhines the gracious man</hi> in the <hi>Valley of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> towards the <hi>Vertical-point</hi> and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of Felicity; the heavenly glory en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſtill in <hi>light,</hi> in <hi>grace,</hi> and in <hi>good fruit:</hi> Nor can he do but ſo, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural movers cannot do otherwiſe in their Motions. Thus alſo do wicked men move freely in their way of wickedneſſe towards the centre of eternal deſtruction.</p>
            <pb n="507" facs="tcp:173117:251"/>
            <p n="3">3. This <hi>proficiency, and encreaſe</hi> in its ſelf, is to be conſidered as <hi>praiſe-worthy,</hi> and very commendable: For, if Skill, trade or ſcience be good, then we ſhould learn, as the Apoſtle adviſeth us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>pulchris operibus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare,</hi> to excel, and ſurmount others in good works: <hi>Schollars, Artificers,</hi> &amp;c. are worthily commended for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Learning, and Skill, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitneſſe in both. <hi>Profitable,</hi> for by this encreaſe and growth in ſtature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the empty Twig, a poor weak plant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fruitfull Tree: yea, the Child becomes a Man. And the <hi>Novice,</hi> a young beginner, or <hi>raw practitioner</hi> in any Skill, Art or Science, one newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or but lately converted to the faith, and into the profeſſion of true Religion, becomes an expert Artiſt, his Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and an experienced Chriſtian in the wayes of Faith and true Religion. And by this, we poor younger Brethren become like our elder Brother, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſharers</hi> with him in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as Wealth, <hi>&amp;c. Ae contrà,</hi> where this encreaſe is not, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:173117:252"/>praiſe-worthy, or profitable, all things void of it are deſpicable, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Grace in it ſelf;</hi> It being once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the Soul, it is expulſive of Death out of theſe pots, or earthen-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, our ſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.4, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 9.21. and that in the cauſe of Death, as that <hi>Meal</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40, 41. It is expulſive, of badneſs and barrenneſs from us, as that <hi>Cruſe of Salt</hi> did from <hi>Jerico's</hi> Land and Waters, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are good preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to growth and fruitfulneſs. It is of a diffuſive Nature, and ſweetens all, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our fruit to be as the ſmell of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> moſt pleaſant, delightfull and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5, 6. Whereas <hi>Leaven and Vice</hi> do ſowr, and impoiſon all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. It is of it ſelf of a growing and <hi>enlarging</hi> Nature, like <hi>good Corn which lives,</hi> not <hi>dead,</hi> but putteth forth <hi>the Blade, the Ear, full Corn in the Ear,</hi> Mark 4.28. Or like <hi>the grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-ſeed,</hi> Mark 4.30, 31, 32. which produceth <hi>a goodly Tree,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31, 32. <hi>ſo that the Fowls of the Ayr may lodge
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:173117:252"/>there</hi> Gods power appears in the growth of Grace (as of his Church alſo) out of very ſmall Beginnings, far beyond all mens expectations, ſo <hi>that the Fowls of the Ayr</hi> &amp;c. i.e. all the godly gave recourſe to Grace, and to the ſaving Word that works it, as to a Refuge of Reſt, in all their tribulations and diſtreſſes, <hi>Aretius,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The event and effect of this <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>fruit,</hi> this encreaſe and abundance, is, that it is a ſingular Remedy againſt <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> the grown Tree is not eaſily writhed, nor the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> ſoon ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But men ſtill employed in good, are like the Fowl upon the Wing, without danger of Gunſhot, or the <hi>Fowlers ſnare,</hi> which others are ſubject to. Or like the <hi>ſwift flowing ſtream,</hi> that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract mud in the <hi>Channel,</hi> as other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do. Or like the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> whoſe continual motion is profective: it prevents and avoids Corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So ſuch <hi>Proficients</hi> as encreaſe and abound in Grace, ſhall be <hi>free from Sathans Snares</hi> and <hi>wiles,</hi> they ſhall not hurt them. And from the <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>filth</hi>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:173117:253"/>the World, it ſhall not infect them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Like the <hi>heavenly Bodies,</hi> they ſhall be eſtabliſhed, confirmed, and perfected in their courſe, and <hi>bleſſed for ever and ever.</hi> You have had Scripture Proofs, Inſtances and Reaſons for the Point.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The next thing to be ſpoken of, is, To take a view of <hi>Grace,</hi> which you (and all Chriſtians) are to encreaſe in. Now <hi>Grace</hi> is put for divers things in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I ſhall not trouble you with the ſeveral Acceptations: but eſpecially it is put for <hi>Gods free and eternal Love and Favour,</hi> which is the Well-ſpring of all our happineſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. For he <hi>hath ſaved, and called us</hi> according to his own purpoſe and Grace before the <hi>world began.</hi> Our free juſtification by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, which is a fruit of the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 17, 20, 21. Our Sanctification by the work of the Spirit of God in us, Renewing in our Souls the Image of God, defaced by ſin, Enabling us <hi>to obey his will,</hi> which power we had loſt; Furniſhing us with <hi>Faith,</hi> and all other <hi>graces</hi> needful to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:173117:253"/>happineſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> all which we were empty of. This is a Fruit of our <hi>free Election</hi> and <hi>Juſtification:</hi> and this we call <hi>Sanctification,</hi> an <hi>hallowing</hi> or <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying us,</hi> in that it extends to all parts and powers of the whole man, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, and perfected in Heaven. Here muſt be no Exception of parts, <hi>head, heart, hand,</hi> &amp;c. muſt all concur: Nor may we preſume to enjoy this Grace of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Heaven, if we have no ſenſe of this Grace on Earth. This is the <hi>Grace</hi> wherein we are to encreaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> In <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more like to God,</hi> in <hi>conformity to his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> and the <hi>likeneſſe of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the abſolute pattern of Holineſs; Encreaſing in <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and performing obedience to Gods Will; Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the number and meaſure of all needfull Graces, encreaſing from a ſmall beginning to a greater, bulk or ſtature till we become Men and Women per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And this growth muſt be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Real,</hi> not <hi>imaginary,</hi> asin <hi>melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> perſons, who fancy things to be great,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:173117:254"/>which are little or nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal to all parts, and to all Times:</hi> Parts, there muſt be no <hi>Rickets</hi> in Religion and Grace as there is in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when growth is in ſome parts only, not in others: though that (as this) is too frequent in our Times, and for times, we know, Natural things ceaſe to grow at a certaine time, as all Creatures do that grow. But it muſt not be ſo with us in this caſe, our growth in Grace muſt laſt while we live, for here we cannot attain to our full ſtature and meaſure of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Effectual;</hi> This growth muſt be to ſome good purpoſe: as when a Child can do the work of a Man, we ſay, he is well grown, and to good purpoſe; So when we <hi>Sapling-poles</hi> are become <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Trees,</hi> fit for any uſe in the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Buildings. So alſo it may be, when well-grown Chriſtians, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſefull as <hi>Pillars</hi> in Gods Houſe; which is his ſpiritual Building, and <hi>men of age and ſtrength for uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ Now this encreaſe in Grace is put upon us, upon excelleut good
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:173117:254"/>grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> From the <hi>excellency, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſufficiency of Grace, in reference to God, our ſelves, our preſent and future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Excellency of Grace appears in reference to God:</hi> Becauſe it is a Beam, a Raie of <hi>Divine Excellency</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> ſo much of Grace, ſo much of God, and of his bleſſed Image: The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus purchaſed it <hi>Merito paſsionis &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsionis,</hi> the holy Spirit that doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it, doth beautifie and dignifie us therewith.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The neceſsity of Grace appears in reſpect of our ſelves,</hi> both in our Perſons and Eſtates. Touching our perſons, <hi>Grace repairs the defects of ſoul and body;</hi> it is light in the mind, order in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſets the body alſo in a right way, by having ſo good a Guide; whereas before, <hi>The blind</hi> (mind) <hi>led the blind</hi> (body) Eſtates, Grace doth advantage us for the, 1. <hi>Preſent,</hi> 2. <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>preſent;</hi> it enriches, for it hath the promiſe of this, <hi>and a better life,</hi> Deut. 28.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Prov. 3.16. <hi>Length of
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:173117:255"/>days, Riches, and Honour are in her right and left hand, and all things ſhall be added to ſuch,</hi> Mat. 6.33. For as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But the godly want, and are oft in neceſsity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe things are given but as they are expedient, <hi>And a little that a righteous man hath, is better,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. There is a <hi>Nimium honoris, volupta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, divitiorum,</hi> &amp;c. We may have ſo much (too much) of theſe, that we may forget, or deny God; as <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9. <hi>And the wicked ſtouriſh to periſh, Pſa l.</hi> 927. But there is <hi>Non nimium Gratiae,</hi> We can never have too much Grace: This cannot be bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Go,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and buy for your ſelves,</hi> are words <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium, non Conſulentium;</hi> intiating, that thoſe who neglect to get Grace here, have no means left to get any then when it is too late. Thus <hi>Elijah did,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.27. He mocks <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts for their folly. See the Annotations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the future, if we have Grace,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:173117:255"/>we ſhall be admitted with the wiſe, elſe excluded and ſhut out with the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12. There is a neceſſity therefore of Grace, if ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The ſufficience of Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in our preſent and future conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In our preſent condition; conſider that Grace doth ſanctifie proſperity, and gives a luſtre to every natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection, elſe Strength, Beauty, Wiſdom, Honour, Eloquence, Riches, and the moſt eminent Endowments, are of no value or repute at all, but are moſt pernicious, if ill-imployed</p>
            <p>Grace ſtrengthens to bear, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. and carries us through croſſes with ſtrength and comfort. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29, 31. <hi>For God doth ſtrengthen them to mount up with wings as Eagles, to run, and walk, and not faint.</hi> It gives content in every condition, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>In want,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſatisfies the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and reſtleſs deſires of the ſoul, it being a Well, a Fountain of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="516" facs="tcp:173117:256"/>
            <p n="2">2. And for the <hi>Future,</hi> in what we hope for; It makes way to glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſo called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and is conjoyned with it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84.11. The Lord will give Grace and Glory; and where he gives the firſt, he will be ſure to give the ſecond.</p>
            <p>It removes impediments that lie in our way to hinder us. Grace puts the Lion out of the way, and plucks up the hedge of Thorns, which do deter and hinder ſlothful men from the purſuit of Glory: See <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.19. &amp; 22.13. &amp; 26.13.</p>
            <p>Grace doth adminiſter all helps and furtherances, which may animate and enable us in the way to life and glory. It will perſwade us to make uſe of all Ordinances, Opportunities and Means, whereby we may be filled with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace, till we attain the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of glory.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the Grace which we are to increaſe in.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be ſpoken of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method propounded, is,</p>
            <p n="5">5. A view of thoſe good works in
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:173117:256"/>which you are ſo to abound; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, we muſt premiſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Rules that declare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our works to be good works.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our works muſt be warranted by the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that it is the light, by which our deeds are made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God, <hi>John</hi> 3.21. In his ſight, and by his rule which he worketh in us, and enables us to do. <hi>Hoc in Deo facimus, quod Deo in nobis faciente, datur nobis, ut faciamus,</hi> Fulgen. de prae. ad Mon. l. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Look we to our ſelves; for the Tree muſt be good, and then the fruit will be ſo, elſe never, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17, 18. &amp; 12.33. We muſt be Believers; for when they asked our Saviour the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>What they might do to work the works of God?</hi> Chriſt anſwers them, and ſaid, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him,</hi> &amp;c. This is our firſt work; with this we muſt begin: <hi>By Faith we are juſtified and accepted of God as good Trees, by whom we are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8.9.10.</p>
            <pb n="518" facs="tcp:173117:257"/>
            <p>Our perſons being accepted, our works will be ſo alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To this we muſt add a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purging our ſelves from droſs, <hi>That we may be veſſels of honour, ſanctified and meet for the maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 2-21. This we muſt do, if we would have our works accepted as good in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beſides, we muſt make it a matter of moſt concernment; It muſt be our Meat, as our Saviour ſpeaks, to do the Will of God; and to finiſh his work, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. The works of God which are good; to do them, muſt be our main buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Ends, to which our good works are directed, muſt be good, elſe ſpoil all. The end crowns or ſhames the work. Now the end of our works, that they may be juſtified, muſt be the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine,</hi> &amp;c. The edification of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the diſcharge of our Obedience, teſtification of our Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 11.10. anſwering of our calling in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. Eſcaping the puniſhment or
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:173117:257"/>ſin, and the deſtruction of the wicked; obtaining the Glory of Heaven; with many other ſubſervient ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, do clearly evidence to us, That Works without warrant from the word of God, how ſpeciou ſoever they be in pretence, and outward appearance, as were the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo of Papiſts, and ſuperſtitious perſons to this day, yet they are rejected; for God is not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with what himſelf preſcribes: We may not deviſe new things in Gods Worſhip, as we pleaſe. Where the Agents are Unbelievers, and not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God: If the Tree remain uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo is the fruit, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> both are unacceptable.</p>
            <p>Where there is no purging of our ſelves, nor preparation to good works, there cannot but be very many miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
            <p>When good works are not our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but fall in by accident, or are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome extremity, as by ſickneſs or death, or when we begin too late, when it is with us, as with them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.27,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:173117:258"/>28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. But we ne, glect our opportunity whileſt we may and loſe all, when we never make them our delight, as we do other matters of natural concernment, ſuch as to eat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our good works are for <hi>ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> baſe or bad ends, <hi>As to be ſeen of men</hi> Phariſee-like, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.5. <hi>To devour widowes houſes,</hi> Mat. 23.14. <hi>or to act miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</hi> To ſuit with the multitude, and pleaſe the world, as they did, <hi>John</hi> 7.7. <hi>That hated Chriſt, and perſecuted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> John 16.2. <hi>who thought it well done;</hi> And ſome real good work may be done to this end. To purchaſe our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and peace with God, as Papiſts and Patrons of Merit think they do, though thereby they do fruſtrate the merits of the Lord Jeſus for us.</p>
            <p>In a word, The ends of our works are many, and that both good and bad, as they are directed by the Agents and Workers of them; But if they be not ſuitable with the Rules before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that our works will not endure the tryal of the light, as <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:173117:258"/>Whether they be of God or no. We have great reafon to ſuſpect, yea, and to reject our own works, as unacceptable and diſpleaſing to Almighty God. Thus much touching the Rules concerning our good works.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But now if any ſhould ſay, <hi>You have given us Rules for our works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what are the works in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in which we are ſo to abound?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Good works are ſuch as are performed by the grace of the holy Spirit, out of a true faith according to the preſcribt Rule of the Law, to the Glory of God, the certainty and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our own ſalvation, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of our Neighbour, <hi>Wolleb.</hi> p. 192. <hi>Polan.</hi> p. 256.</p>
            <p>And theſe good works muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed out of ſuch a true faith, by which we are ſure that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and that both we and our works are pleaſing to God through Chriſt, <hi>Pol.</hi> 258.</p>
            <p>And for the names conferred upon good works, <hi>They are called the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> from their efficient cauſe,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:173117:259"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.9. The fruits of Faith from the inſtrumental cauſe. The works of the Law, from the form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuitable to it, and from their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, good works, and good fruits.</p>
            <p>For their number; for they are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs, extending to all the affections and actions of a regenerate man, <hi>Wall.</hi> p. 293. and to all thoſe things preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moral Law of God, about which ſuch actions and works are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, <hi>Bucan.</hi> 334. So that for this, I muſt only ſay, as the Apoſtle doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whatſoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, every ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> And every praiſe-worthy action en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the liſt, and helps to make up the number and meaſure of works that be good in the ſight of God, <hi>Bucan.</hi> p. 333, 334.</p>
            <p>As to the cauſes of good works, they are many, eſpecially theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The principal efficient cauſe, it God, his Grace and holy Spirit, who doth begin, continue, and perfect all our good works in us,</hi> Phil. 1.6. &amp; 2.13. He that begins,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:173117:259"/>will perform to the utmoſt: <hi>And it is God which worketh in us both to will, and to do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> John 15.5. So then our good works are not the fruits of our own free-will, as <hi>Pelagians, Papiſts,</hi> and too many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The inſtrumental cauſe is Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Root</hi> whence all good works do ſpring, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For it worketh by love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The matter of our good works</hi> is our affections and our actions, and all things about which they are converſant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The formal cauſe of them,</hi> is, their conformity to, and agreement with the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119: 1.2, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.18, 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Elſe all is vain worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The final cauſe or end of our good works is manifold,</hi> and may be diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into things referring to, 1. <hi>God.</hi> 2. <hi>Ourſelves.</hi> And, 3. <hi>Our Neighbour.</hi> In reference to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God:</hi> His glory is the main end, our due obedience to his Will and Command, and our thankfulneſs for our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and all other benefits are hereby teſtified.</p>
            <pb n="524" facs="tcp:173117:260"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> We do good works, to evidence the life of our faith, <hi>which elſe is dead, being alone,</hi> Jam. 2.17. <hi>Solitaria.</hi> To get ſure that we are juſtified before God: for <hi>Bona opera ſequuntur juſtificatos, non praecedunt juſtificandos. To make ſure our Election to eternal life,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. To exerciſe, nouriſh, and ſtrengthen our Faith, to adorn our Vocation, to avoid temporal and eternal puniſhment, that we may receive the Reward of well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely promiſed by Almighty God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21, 23. <hi>Well done good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Our Neighbour;</hi> That we may be hurtful to none, but uſeful and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all to our power, <hi>Thereby to edifie the faithful, and to win unbelievers,</hi> Wal. <hi>p.</hi> 260, 261.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Species,</hi> or particular kinds or forms of good works; The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions ſo ſtyled are very many, yet you may diſtinguiſh or diſtribute them into three Channels, <hi>viz. As works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring,</hi> 1. <hi>To God.</hi> 2. <hi>Our ſelves:</hi> And, 3. <hi>Our Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To God,</hi> and ſo the whole worſhip
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:173117:260"/>of God, and every particular branch of the ſame, are good works, whether they refer to the inward Worſhip of God, as a right and true acknowledgement of God, Love towards him, Truſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him by a lively ſaving faith, and aſſured hope in him; as alſo by <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in the ſence of his greatneſſe, and goodneſs to us even in our Afflictions. The inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip of God jointly and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Such are the Acts of Invocation of God by prayer, <hi>with fasting ſometimes,</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.2, 3. or by lawful oaths, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>aſſertory</hi> or <hi>promiſſory,</hi> affirming ſome needful truth, or promiſing ſome lawful and uſeful thing, as oaths of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of Allegiance, giving of thanks by a celebration of God, and giving him glory in the approbation, admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and right eſtimation of all his works.

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:173117:264"/>and multiplying bad works and fruits daily.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz. How want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are in good works,</hi> we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a ſhort, but yet a very full account with <hi>Salomon,</hi> Eccl. 1.15. That which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight, and that which is wanting cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered: For as for that little meaſure of Grace we have, and thoſe few good Works which we do, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how crooked, perverſe tortuous or writhed they be from the ſtraitneſſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs &amp; excellency which ſhould be in them, they are as nothing; But if we conſider, how much Grace, and how many good Works are wanting, we may well ſay with a learned Interpreter, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finita deſiderantur, in quibus pietas &amp; probitas verſatur:</hi> we are infinitely wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both in Grace and good Works. For our <hi>Graces,</hi> how few are they, and thoſe few how defective, if you ſhould take a view of particulars, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And gor our <hi>good works,</hi> how defective are we to God, in our Invocation of God, whither by prayers or oaths, &amp;c. or <hi>giving

To our ſelves, how defective are we in the exerciſe of our Graces, Vertues, Parts and Abilities, whatſoever they be? We rather ſuffer them to Ruſt, and become unprofitable like him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. And to others, how wanting are we in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars named, <hi>viz.</hi> In our <hi>Humanity, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, Chriſtian charity,</hi> with the happy fruits thereof, <hi>viz. Liberality, giving Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Comfort, Amity, Sympathy, and readineſſe to do good.</hi> In <hi>the exerciſe of that</hi> common Juſtice, Righteouſneſs and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which we do owe to all, in all our Affaires, Actions and Dealings, both privately and publickly: of all which we may ſay, <hi>Where are they, are they not loſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, In the reſtraint and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:173117:265"/>moderation of our inordinate and unruly paſſions, affections and motions of mind, which do ariſe from <hi>pride, anger, evil concupiſcence</hi> and unlawfull deſires, <hi>which are ſo apt to boyl</hi> up in our ſinfull Souls to the prejudice of others, yea, and to our ſelves alſo, whilſt we feed, cheriſh and purſue them.</p>
            <p>Should we purſue theſe particulars as before-named, it were an endleſſe work to innumerate our Wants, for that <hi>which is wanting cannot be numbred,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 1.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now for the ſecond particular, <hi>if we conſider how wicked we be</hi> in producing and abounding in bad Works and Fruits, <hi>we have reaſon to abhor our ſelves, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.6. for how apt are we to produce <hi>the works of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.19. <hi>adultery, fornication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> Eph. 5.11. <hi>dead works,</hi> that have the Lineament, but not the life of good Works, or ſins which expoſe us to death; <hi>the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which</hi> Chriſt came to deſtroy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. So like are we to the <hi>barren Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> in our emptineſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6. Or to
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:173117:266"/>the <hi>bad Vine</hi> in our Fulneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.24. for our Fruits are degenerated, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21.

Such are our unſavoury fruits of <hi>luxury, lust and uncleanneſſe,</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruits of <hi>envy and ſtrife,</hi> James 3.14. Some <hi>diſtaſtfull</hi> fruit of <hi>anger and paſsion</hi> James 1.20. <hi>Inſipid</hi> and <hi>indigeſted fruits</hi> of Gluttony, Drunkenneſſe, and fulneſſe of Bread, and all intemperance. <hi>Cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive fruit</hi> of ſloth and idleneſs (in the love of God, &amp; practiſe of good works) <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c. poverty, ſhame and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, are the cold fruits of a ſlothfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Corroſive, ill reliſh't fruit of cruelty, covetouſneſs and oppreſsion,</hi> which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the taſt of our Souls, ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well relliſh (but diſguſt) the taſt of
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:173117:266"/>ſpiritual things: <hi>Hard, high-grown fruit of pride</hi> and diſdain, the Fruits of <hi>Mount Gilboa</hi> without <hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>dew</hi> of any divine Grace in them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Such are proud perſons, Rotten, worm-eaten fruit</hi> of vitious Manners: which expoſe us to the dunghill, or the <hi>Swines-trough,</hi> Luke 15.15, 16. and provoke the <hi>worm that ſhall never dye,</hi> Eſay 66.24. Mark 9.14, 46, 48. <hi>to live in us,</hi> to torment and conſume us for ever, like them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So forwardly are we to abound in ſuch Fruits and Works as end in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſo unapt to thoſe good works to <hi>which we are created, redeemed and ſanctified,</hi> and which have the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements (and Motives) of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of well-doing,</hi> which is ever atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with abundant comfort in Life and Death, and for ever; as <hi>E contra,</hi> The clearing of our Faith and implantation into Chriſt, the acceptance of God, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom we muſt appear,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. The eternal <hi>Reward,</hi> promiſed to <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi> Mat. 25.21, 23, 34. This is a <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> and ſhall be for a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> Ezek. 19.14.</p>
            <pb n="538" facs="tcp:173117:267"/>
            <p>Thus from this firſt Uſe of <hi>Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for our being ſo wanting in good and abounding in bad Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed to the uſe of <hi>Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which is, <hi>To all ſuch as are at ſo little coſt and pains to get</hi> Grace, <hi>and ſo little care to abound in good works, whilſt they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied</hi> in the purſuit of other things; and <hi>here we may juſtly blame men of ſeveral Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 How many young Children, the Infantry of the Church, are rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, as being never taught and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Principles of Religion, the great fault of Parents: Whereas young <hi>Timothy was taught,</hi> and <hi>knew</hi> the Holy Scriptures from his very Infancy, <hi>by which he became</hi> wiſe unto Salvation, <hi>a man of God perfect,</hi> throughly furniſhed unto <hi>all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.5, &amp;c. <hi>Whoſe parents are an</hi> Exemplary pattern to all Parents in the World, though they be little imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in our Times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Young men,</hi> who though they have <hi>rich opportunities</hi> and much means to get Grace; <hi>strong abilities and activities</hi> to apprehend, remember and do what they
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:173117:267"/>have learned and do know; Yet for want of due conſideration, that <hi>they are under</hi> uncertainties, both of Life and the means of Grace: For they may die in their ſtrength, and the means may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and that <hi>Temptations may ſo prevail,</hi> and lie ſo heavy upon them that they cannot grow: <hi>yet they take no care to get this ſtrength,</hi> that they may overcome the Devil.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Old men, in whom</hi> though the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man decayes,</hi> and the <hi>Soul must flit</hi> ſhortly from this Cottage of clay: Yet they <hi>take no care with</hi> the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. that <hi>thaugh the outward man periſh, yet the inward man might be renewed day by day</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> in ſpiritual ſtrength, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.31. Nor do they <hi>ſtrive to cloſe with good works,</hi> as <hi>Dorcas</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.39. The Apoſtle and Evangeliſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. writes with more comfort ſure, where he ingeminates his Writings to Chriſtians of all Ages: whether little <hi>Children, Fathers, Young men,</hi> or <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, experienced Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Reſolute</hi> Profeſſors of good ſtanding, in any of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:173117:268"/>theſe Ages and Conditions, the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> ſpeaks to them twice a piece with joy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To little children,</hi> becauſe their ſins are forgiven, and becauſe they <hi>have known the Father.</hi> It is a moſt happy thing when Children, or Babes (which either in Age, or Religion) are thus waſhed ſpiritually from ſin, as it befell thoſe <hi>new Converts,</hi> Acts 10.43. And when ſo well inſtructed as to <hi>know God</hi> (their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) betime, and to give him Honour, as Children and new Converts do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To fathers,</hi> becauſe <hi>they have known him that he is from the beginning,</hi> i. e. <hi>Old men</hi> have been long acquainted with Chriſt, and have the Knowledge of him in a greater meaſure then other Chriſtians; and happy are gray hairs found ſo, in a long-continued experimental knowledge of God, and of Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To young men,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in them, and they have overcome the wicked one.</hi> When ſpiritual ſtrength is joyned to bodily ſtrength: and the Word of God <hi>dwels,</hi> and abides in young men to Rule them: And that their greateſt Conqueſts
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:173117:268"/>are over the Devil, who is the moſt powerfull and ſpightfull Adverſary: then ſuch a ſanctified Youth is truly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious and Glorious, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. But ſurely the Apoſtles times were better then ours: For generally, Many remain <hi>weak, or ſick, or dead,</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the means of life &amp; health is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Weak,</hi> that they remain Babes in Chriſt ſtill, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. and muſt be fed accordingly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. when they might have been Teachers, for the time they had enjoyed the means of Knowledge. <hi>Sick,</hi> That they grow worſe and worſe like evil men and Seducers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. Like <hi>Epheſus</hi> they have loſt their firſt Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Or as <hi>Laodocea</hi> are grown luke-warm, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14, 16. with <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they firſt <hi>love,</hi> &amp; then <hi>loath Manna,</hi> Num. 21.5. or with <hi>Galatians,</hi> begin in the ſpirit, &amp; end in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were Nipt with the leaſt perſecution, <hi>John</hi> 12.42, 43. ſo are theſe. Theſe leave Orthodox Truths for Heterodox Opinions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. And <hi>forſake the old and good way</hi> for new paths of their own invention and making.</p>
            <pb n="542" facs="tcp:173117:269"/>
            <p n="1">1. This is the caſe and ſin of Many, not conſidering that in Grace and doing good, there is no <hi>Solſtitium</hi> or <hi>retrograde Motion:</hi> For <hi>non progredi eſt regredi, qui non proſicit Deficit, &amp; Qui nihil acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, non nihil perdit;</hi> Here's no ſtanding ſtill: He that goes not forward, goes backward; and he that gains not, loſeth all: This is their ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And <hi>for puniſhment;</hi> what can be expected leſſe, then the removeal of the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> except we Repent, and do the <hi>firſt works,</hi> Revel. 2.5.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Dead, yea stark dead</hi> in ſin: They <hi>are ſo wicked,</hi> ſo that we cannot ſay as Chriſt ſaid to that Nobleman, whoſe Son was ſick at <hi>Capernaum; Thy Son liveth,</hi> John 4.46.50.

            </p>
            <p>☞ In this caſe what can we do, but
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:173117:269"/>have recourſe to Chriſt, and pray: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ariſe O Chriſt;</hi> and he ſay to us as to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11.43. <hi>Come forth.</hi> Or, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead; and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Then, if the Lord ſhall ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with his Glory: as <hi>Eſay</hi> 60.1, 2. and Command: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake</hi> O North-wind, and come thou South, and blow upon my Garden, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may flow out; then ſhall we awake, riſe out of our Graves, and begin to ſpring; then ſhall we become like a <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Garden,</hi> or a Field that the Lord hath bleſſed: Or the Trees of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God: Or the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> that he hath planted; Yea, we ſhall be able to invite our Saviour: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let my Beloved come into his Garden and eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi> Thus much for the ſecond Uſe of Reproof.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Uſe of Exhortation, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, 1. Great men: 2. All men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Great men of Eminency, Dignity and Authority. Such are Eminent Trees in the Garden of God in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Ezek.
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:173117:270"/>31.8, 9. more excellent then others: as being more tall in ſtatute, Eminent in their Eſtates &amp; other accompliſhments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Strong in power to over-awe and command others, by the Dignity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority conferred upon them. Therefore it behoves them to be moſt Eminent in Grace and abundant in good Works, that they may be like the Trees in Gods Houſe: thoſe Palm-trees and Cedars, <hi>pſalm</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. which are firmly rooted, ſound and imputrible, ſtraight and upright Ornaments in their places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſhould ſuch men be, Rooted and grounded in the truth, as Trees of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be; and not like <hi>Pilate,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what is Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.38. Sound and uncorrupt, imputrible in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as Cedars are. Straight and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in all their proceedings, as ſome choiſe Trees are in their growth, not writhed and crooked. Ornaments to the Church of God, as the Palms trees were to the Temple. Pillars in Gods houſe, a ſhelter, a ſupport to his place, as the ſtrongeſt trees are in great build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Abundant in good fruits and works
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:173117:270"/>like the beſt fruit-trees, and that in the faithful adminiſtration of their places to the publick good, and in their acts of piety, mercy, and charity to the poor. Such men of Eminency ſhould reſemble the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon:</hi> whoſe odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſavour is ſuch, That <hi>Fugat Serpentes, &amp; interficit vermes,</hi> ſay ſome Authors; ſo ſhould the ſavour of their <hi>good oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> viz. Divine graces, and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practiſe. The preſence and perfume of their power, and piety ſhould be of Efficacy to kill the Canker-worms that blaſt us: and to chaſe away, or put to flight thoſe Serpents which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us.</p>
            <p>If our Nobility, Gentry, and men of Eminency were ſuch, their good names ſhould flouriſh like the Palm, and ſpread abroad like the fruitful Vines and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees: Then we the underwood of the ſame Garden of God ſhould <hi>Digna Cedro canere,</hi> record and ſing the praiſes of thoſe Cedars which God hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 80.10. &amp; 104.16. Whilſt they do reſemble the Tree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12, 20, 21. which was ſo ſtrong, tall,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:173117:271"/>fair and fruitful, for all: So ſuch, whoſe root is piety, body prudence, branches power, and fruit is juſtice, mercy, and every good work: For ſuch men, we bleſs the God of heaven, and ſay,
<q>Arbor honoretur, cujus nos umbra tuetur.</q> And when ſuch men ſhall dye like men, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.6, 7. Yet by the ſeat of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<hi>viz.</hi> Of divine Grace by Chriſt, and the Vertue of his Reſurrection) they ſhall bud, <hi>Job</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. Riſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſing in eternal glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>E contra,</hi> For the Nobility and Gentry of a Nation to be like thoſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It will but entitle them to be Rulers of Sodom, Princes and people of Gomorrah,</hi> Iſa. 1.10.</p>

            <p>And thus much for the firſt branch of this Uſe to great men.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now the ſecond branch of this
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:173117:271"/>Uſe of Exhortation, is <hi>To all men; For all men ought to labour for this increaſe and proficiency:</hi> which that they may the better do, they muſt take a like courſe with themſelves, as <hi>Arboriſts</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts</hi> uſe to do with their <hi>Orchards</hi> and <hi>Gardens,</hi> the <hi>trees</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> which they would have to thrive and proſper, <hi>They muſt prune off, and weed out, ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, as hinder them, provide ſuch means, and helps as may further their growth and flouriſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, the weeds and ſuperfluous branches which this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard and Garden ſhould be quit of, for ſothe Church is called, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12, 13. and frequently, That the choiſe fruits and flowers of the ſame may proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are idleneſs or neglect of the means of growth or proficiency.</p>
            <p>Neglect the Fire, and it will go out of it ſelf, or the Scholler or Pupil his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Readings, and his growth in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſoon be at a ſtand. Let the Child or any other perſon neglect his food; or mark any man that doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect his neceſſary buſineſs, and obſerve
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:173117:272"/>
               <hi>what increaſe and abounding will enſue:</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>ſluggards field,</hi> Prov. 24.30, 31. Or ſuppoſe the Trees Root ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to fetch in ſap, or the branches to receive it, they are dead, off with them. Our Ears are as the Root, our actions are the branches of theſe Trees of the Garden of God.</p>
            <p>If we refuſe to hearken to Councel, and receive advice, or having received, (like dead branches) if we do not act and expreſs the ſame in our fruit, we are dead.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In a word, <hi>Do but neglect the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, Garden or Field, and ſee what will become of it, if all do not run to ruine,</hi> &amp;c. How many with us had need to prune off this dead branch of Idlenefs and Neglect! Sure multitudes are guilty of of it; <hi>Ergo, We have the more need to fall to this work ſpeedily, which that you may the better effect,</hi> ſhall I lend you a weeding or pruning hook to fetch off theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous branches as you meet with them; Then for this firſt dead branch of <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> let induſtry and diligence be the <hi>pruning hook</hi> to take off this: For
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:173117:272"/>this will look out far and near (as the living roots of trees do) to fetch in ſap to ſupply the ſoul: Its the ſouls purveyer to fetch in proviſions of all ſorts. This <hi>Enriches</hi> a man both in his outward, and in his inward eſtate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. &amp; 13.4. <hi>His wealth increaſeth, and his ſoul ſhall be made fat.</hi> In the bodily condition, a man may be fed with the choiceſt food, and poſſibly may be ſupplied with all the <hi>Viands</hi> and <hi>Delicates</hi> imaginable, and yet be neither ſtrengthened nor fatted in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by them: For the bleſſing of God may be wanting in theſe caſes; <hi>And man liveth not by bread only,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4. <hi>But for ſuch as ſeek first the kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>and labour with diligence for the heavenly food:</hi> The bleſſing of God is never wanting to ſuch, <hi>but that they ſhall grow and increaſe, be strengthened and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as calves of the ſtall,</hi> Mal. 4.2. <hi>viz. In the graces of Regeneration and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tending to ſalvation;</hi> See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-conceteitedneſs,</hi> an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our own worth and ſufficiency. The freſh man that thinks himſelf as
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:173117:273"/>wiſe and learned as his Tutor, and the Artiſt as expert as his Teacher, the raw ſervant, as his Maſter and Miſtriſs, wanting no direction of either, and the Soldier as wiſe as his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.12.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe are like thoſe Phariſees, who ſaid, <hi>We ſee,</hi> i. e. <hi>We know enough;</hi> For they had a great opinion of their own knowledge and ſanctity, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ſcorned to learn, or to be taught by any, <hi>John</hi> 9.24, 40, 41.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or like thoſe holy <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> that thought they had need of nothing, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. when they wanted all things: and ſure, ſuch as think themſelves wiſe or learned, healthy or wealthy enough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will never take much care for either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Increaſe. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>that not many wiſemen, or mighty;</hi> but God hath choſen the fooliſh and weak, and baſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28, 29, <hi>i.e.</hi> Such as know, and Eſteem themſelves to be ſuch, as they ſtand before God, without any worth, merit, ſtrength or Vertue, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:173117:273"/>
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Who is <hi>Paul?</hi> and and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore low in their own eyes, ſuch are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that this Self-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a Rank leavy Branch without Fruit, and ſuch will hinder the tree from ever bearing any: therefore off with them and ſpare them not. Now the beſt pruning-hook to fetch off this Branch is Humility, to be low and baſe in our own ſight, as <hi>David</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. This is 1. A Cabinet full of Excellent Pearls: 2. A valley of Grace, which makes a ſoul like a watered Garden, a fruitfull Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow beſpangled with Beauties: yea like a Field which the Lord hath bleſſed; or the Trees by him planted, which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fruitfull, fat and flouriſhing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Worldlineſſe.</hi> This is the next ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Branch to be cut off, when our hearts are too much ſet upon this World, The World (you know) is three-fold: 1, The old World which periſhed by Water, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. 2. The preſent World in which we do now live, which is evil,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:173117:274"/>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. And paſſeth away, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.17. 3. The World to come, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where is Life everlaſting. It were well if we did mind this laſt World more then we do. It is then the preſent World, and the things thereof which I ſpeak of: And by worldlineſs or earthly mindedneſs, I mean, ſetting our hearts on theſe things below. Principally and in the firſt place, as <hi>Eſau</hi> and the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> Unconſcionably, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and the unjuſt Steward did. Inordinately and impatiently, as <hi>Rachel</hi> and the Horſleech: Inſatiably as the grave barren womb, the Earth, and the Fire, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15, 16. Securely and voluptuouſly relying upon the World, as they did, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This minding of the world and affecting it too much, is a <hi>Bait</hi> which ſhewes the beſt, but hides the worſt from us. A <hi>beam</hi> in our eyes, that we cannot ſee what is beſt for us. A <hi>Thorn</hi> in our Feet, that we cannot walk for ſtrength. A <hi>Canker</hi> in our mouthes, that we cannot eat the beſt Food. A <hi>Snare</hi> to our Souls that prevents all our chief good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> This hinders our growth extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:173117:274"/>when we ſo ſet our hearts upon theſe ſublunary things, which we are apt to do: Mark the Caution, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.10. <hi>Truſt not in oppreſsion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If riches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them.</hi> This made ſome err from the faith. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>The Love of money,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Demas</hi> to forſake the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>☞ Theſe are weeds &amp; Brambles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which muſt be cut off and rooted up: Which the better to effect and do; The beſt Inſtrument that I can ſupply you now with, is <hi>Heavenly mindedneſs:</hi> Take the Apoſtles Counſel. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Seek the things above, and ſet your affections on them.</hi> The Apoſtle uſeth two words of great weight, and emphatical ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</p>

               </gap>, <hi>Set your affections,</hi> Ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mentem refertur, <hi>The whole ſoul with all the powers thereof, must act this way;</hi> and the word importeth, To <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>regard,</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>care</hi> for thoſe things moſt which are above and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: And thoſe things are, <hi>The bleſſed Trinity, God the Father, his only Son Jeſus Christ, and the holy Spirit of God, bleſsed for ever and ever,</hi> and alſo all the fruits, graces and bleſſings which proceed from the Father, from Chriſt, and his holy Spirit, and are poured out upon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to us, both here and hereafter: in this, and in the life to come. Such are the means of ſalvation, the Graces and the priviledges of Saints, all tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the final perfection and glory of a Chriſtian in heaven; all are from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>In a word, Holineſs and Happineſs are above in the preſence of Chriſt. If we were acquainted with, and our hearts ſet upon theſe things above, we ſhould ſoon ſet a right price upon all earthtly
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:173117:275"/>things, and look upon all ſublunary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as baſe and brittle in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in compariſon of other things, and unable and inſufficient to ſtead us at our need, becauſe they cannot fill the heart, and ſatisfie the deſire. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Why do ye,</hi> &amp;c. Nor leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then life. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.6. <hi>No ranſome to live ever.</hi> Prevent Gods Judgement, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.17, 18, 19.

            <p>Were theſe and the like things right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered and practiſed, it would ſoon cure us of our earthly-mindedneſs, and ſtock up by the roots theſe weeds and brambles, which do ſo hinder the growth of better fruit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The cuſtome and allowance of ſmaller ſins in the worlds account, at
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:173117:276"/>leaſt, ſuch are lying, petty oaths, fleſhly luſt: This is like the ill diet of ſome young people, which eat (Oat-meal, and other) odd things, till they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their health. Or like the ſmall flyes that blaſt the flouriſhing Boughs of the faireſt trees, and will deſtroy the trees at length, though not ſo ſoon as a Thunder-bolt or an Ax.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Theſe muſt be ſmothered and kil'd, or they will ſpoil all: They war and fight againſt the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. to deſtroy it, even as thoſe do againſt the health and life of people and trees: And a ſmall leak in a Ship may ſink it, a Needle or Bodkin may kill a man, as well as a great Cannon-Bullet, or any other Weapon of War and Violence.</p>
            <p>I have read how the greateſt Beaſts, Fiſhes and Serpents are annoyed with things, the Elephant, Whales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the cure of this Annoyance to the choiceſt plants, I can preſcribe you no better means or remedy, then the Conſcience of all, even the ſmalleſt duties which God hath commanded, <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>must be done,</hi>
               <pb n="557" facs="tcp:173117:276"/>yet <hi>Mint, Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> muſt be tithed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. The Conſcience of Duty will expell the cuſtome of ſin. Acquaintance and intercourſe with God by duty, will exclude the allowance of any iniquity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Evil Company and bad ſociety is a great hinderance; Theſe are like <hi>Aſh-trees</hi> in an <hi>Orchard,</hi> or <hi>Cole-worths</hi> among the <hi>Vines,</hi> or <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Brambles</hi> in the Garden or Corn-field.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that neither <hi>Orchard</hi> nor <hi>Vineyard,</hi> nor <hi>Field</hi> or <hi>Garden</hi> can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſper, if they be ſo attended. Theſe are ſuch under-brances, ſuch Suckers at the Tree-root, that they quite ſpoil the growth and ſtature, the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and fruitfulneſs of the Trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which they are permitted and ſuffered to grow: Such Society as this doth always leave an evil blaſt behind them among the Trees of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, <hi>i. e. Good men:</hi> for that it will be conjectured, and much ſuſpected, whether they be not of the ſame quality with theſe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy weeds, or at leaſt, in danger to
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:173117:277"/>be wrought upon to be for their guide and practiſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is no ſmall hurt. The only remedy which I can preſcribe for this malady, is <hi>Good fociety:</hi> This doth, as it were, <hi>Transform a man into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape:</hi> it doth poſſeſs him with thoſe Notions which do prevalently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him into another practiſe; In which being habituted by continuance, he is well armed and fortified againſt all <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> whether they be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or temptations which do invite him to a contrary courſe of practiſe. <hi>The words of the wiſe remain with him, as nails faſtened in the building,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.11. <hi>To hold him ſtedfaſt from ſwarving upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much be ſpoken of this firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>viz. The removal, or the pruning off and weeding out ſuch ſuperſtuities as hinder theſe plants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing to be done, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to ſome ſuch means and helps as may further the proficiency, the growth and flouriſhing of theſe plants in the garden of God. If you enquire how that may be done, I anſwer, <hi>By
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:173117:277"/>gaining, and making good uſe of theſe things,</hi> The Spirit of God, the Vine-dreſſers pains, the means and opportunities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and good ſociety, all which do much conduce hereto. Make ſure of a principle of life in theſe plants, without which there can be no growth, each plant muſt have a life in it, each man a ſoul, and each ſoul muſt have the ſpirit of God in it, elſe all are dead, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be expected from them. This Spirit of God is a principle of life; gain this. Things grow and flouriſh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrength of life in them: And as the Soul makes the body ſtrong and active, ſo doth the <hi>Spirit of God make our ſouls,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17, 18. <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty from the burdens and preſſures which hinder profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> viz. <hi>the Law in the curſe of it, and ſin in the power of it,</hi> &amp;c. But not at all to vice and licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>This Spirit is of ſuch efficacy, that it doth transform them that have it, <hi>into the ſame likeneſs or likeneſs of Chriſt, and of his Spirit,</hi> that as ſilver ſet againſt the Sun becomes radiant, and ſendeth forth
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:173117:278"/>beams: <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>face ſhone by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with God,</hi> Exod 34.30. So will it be here: <hi>Here will be light and luſtre, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from grace to grace, and from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This Spirit inſuſeth life into every part and power of the Soul: And as the Soul is in every part, the blood is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into every vein, and ſap into every branch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So this Spirit doth immit and put in life and vigour, and ſap into every limme and branch, and ſo makes the Tree to live: this layes a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reareth the houſe, which before was not: this Spirit of God doth thus begin this work. And as this Spirit of God thus infuſeth life, and layes the foundation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and begins theſe trees and buildings, ſo,</p>
            <p n="2">II. It ſupplies theſe trees with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and makes each tree to flouriſh and increaſe in ſtature and fruitfulneſs. It furniſheth the houſe alſo, being built, and becautifies every room; Elſe when would this plant and houſe be uſeful, all would be but empty, naked and bare,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:173117:278"/>without this Addition: But this Spirit puts on new Habits and Qualities in a perſon, which anſwers the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Beauty of the choiſeſt plants, and the richeſt Furniture of moſt ſumptuous Buildings.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This <hi>Spirit giveth</hi> power to the ſoul to make uſe of all it hath: the Tree in Winter, and the man aſleep have habits, but not the uſe of them: and an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man may have an inſtrument of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or for work, but cannot uſe it, ſo is it with him that wants the Spirit of God; He hath a Soul and Body, the powers of the one, and parts of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He may be a man of great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Learning, Memory, Elocution, and other natural and acquired Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but he can make uſe of none of all theſe to any purpoſe, but to his owne ruine and deſtruction, till he be indued with this <hi>life</hi> from above, this good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whileſt he that hath it, hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power to make uſe of all to the beſt Ends and purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This <hi>Spirit</hi> giveth Eſſicacy to all the means of growth and proficiency;
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:173117:279"/>a man may uſe induſtry about his plants, but he cannot give Efficacy, nor impart the deſired Effect This makes the Word to be a word of <hi>grace</hi> to us, which is able to build us up, and to give us an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. And it enliveneth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with ſighs &amp; groans which do pierce the Heavens, and enter into the Eares of the Lord Almighty.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Now if you enquire further, how this Spirit may be gotten and obtained; and being gotten, how it may be kept &amp; continued withus?</hi> I anſwer, 1. <hi>Wait.</hi> 2. <hi>Pray.</hi> 3. <hi>Obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wait for the Spirit of God</hi> in the preaching of the Word; Mark that, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. While <hi>Peter</hi> yet ſpake (preaching the Word) the holy Ghoſt fell on all the hearers to their converſion, &amp; ſalvation. This was an happy Sermon, and they were happy Hearers; Who knows when the Spirit of God like that good Angel, <hi>John</hi> 5. will deſcend, and ſo trouble (or work upon) theſe Water; of his Word, as to make it alike effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to <hi>heal</hi> our Souls, to <hi>convert, cure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrengthem us.</hi> Thoſe perſons, <hi>Gal.</hi>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:173117:279"/>3.2, 5. Received the Spirit by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith preached.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Pray for the Spirit.</hi> If we once have but a taſt of the Spirit, we ſhall deſire and pray for more, for a greater meaſure of it then we had before: as <hi>Solomon</hi> did for Wiſdom, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.5, 9. He prayes for an underſtanding (or hearing) heart, to diſcern between good and bad in Judgement. Mark this: <hi>that wiſdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth by hearing; A hearing</hi> Heart is very like to become a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding heart; and as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did for <hi>Elijah's</hi> Spirit, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9. He prayes for a double portion of <hi>Elijah's</hi> Spirit: and you know how they ſped, for both <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> had their deſire to the full: their prayers granted with intereſt. <hi>Prayer</hi> opens Gods Cabinet, for thy ſelf, thy Friends, and others.</p>
            <p>To cloſe this particular, mark the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, precept, promiſes,</hi> and Compariſons uſed by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1. to 14. He himſelf prayes, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Nevertheleſſe, that he was ſo good, ſo excellent, that all fulneſs of the Spirit (yea of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head) <hi>dwelt in him,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:173117:280"/>
               <hi>teacheth his Diſciples how to pray,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them a Form of prayer to help them in the Duty, <hi>v.</hi> 2.3, 4. He <hi>preſſeth importunity in prayer,</hi> by the compariſon of the importunate Friend for Bread at Midnight, who obtained becauſe of his importunity, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 7, 7, 8. He <hi>promiſeth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to importunate</hi> Suitors, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 13. To the former compariſon of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Friend, he now addeth another compariſon from the natural affection of <hi>Parents</hi> to their <hi>Children,</hi> v. 11.12, 13. which he applyeth with a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the end. In both which Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons there is a ſtrong Argument, from the worſer to the better; from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to the ſtronger: For if the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Friend, will give for importunities ſake; And if Parents, that are (often) wicked, as well as weak and poor, will give good gifts to their Children: How much more will God who is ſo willing, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.24. who is ſo great, ſo good, ſo rich, powerfull and gracious (as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed) <hi>give good things;</hi> yea, and that moſt excellent gift of all, even the holy Spirit to them that ask him, as
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:173117:280"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 13. This is a great Encouragement: And thus much for this ſecond Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to gain the Spirit, <hi>viz. Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, <hi>Obey the Spirit in the Motions</hi> and Excitements of it. This is the good voyce behind us: ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk ye in it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.20, 21. The Spirit doth this by the Word and faithfull Teachers; and this is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means to keep the Spirit, once gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to continue the Spirit of God with you.</p>
            <p>☞ Take ſpecial care that you neither <hi>reſiſt,</hi> nor <hi>grieve,</hi> nor <hi>quench the Spirit:</hi> Of which ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19. The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in Scripture, is put for either the <hi>perſon,</hi> the <hi>gifts and gracious Endowments, and the Motions of the Spirit:</hi> theſe Scriptures cited, do extend to all the three. Only note, that the Gifts are of three ſorts, tending to particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: as in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Spirit for Government, which was loſt after a while. <hi>General graces</hi> tending to <hi>ſànctification,</hi> ſuch as Faith in ſome kind; Remorſe for ſin; And joy in the Goſpel
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:173117:281"/>in ſome meaſure; Alſo <hi>a taſt</hi> of the good Word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> But of all theſe, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alezander</hi> made ſhip-wrack, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. Such (like the Corn ſown upon the Rock, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.6, 13) may make a ſhew for a time, but in time of Temptation fall away, <hi>Cain, Judas and Herod,</hi> &amp;c. did look a litlle this way, and many others, but all came to nothing ſuddenly. There is the Root and Habits of <hi>heavenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which are in the godly: and theſe cannot be loſt, the Gates of Hell cannot <hi>prevail againſt them,</hi> Mat. 16.18. to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Now to apply theſe Gifts quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to particular Employments: as it was in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be loſt. So alſo the <hi>gifts diſpoſing to Sanctification,</hi> may be as in <hi>Hymeneus and Alexander</hi> before-namd. And for the <hi>beſt gifts,</hi> the exerciſe of them may be intermitted: as in <hi>David,</hi> about <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> As <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are in ſleep and <hi>paſsion,</hi> the heat and fervor of Gifts may be abated in ſome meaſure: as in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Revel. 2.4. <hi>Suggeſtions and particular</hi> motions of the
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:173117:281"/>Spirit may be repelled. And thus: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>habitus non amittitur,</hi> Yet <hi>Actus intermittitur, &amp; gradus remittitur,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals too often to the dear ſervants of God. Therefore to keep our ſpiritual gifts in Life and Vigor: the means are 1. <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and</hi> Employment; 2. <hi>Good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and</hi> holy Obedience, 1 Tim. 1.19.3. <hi>Humility,</hi> that <hi>conſervatrix virtutum,</hi> Bern. 4. <hi>The uſe of holy Aſſemblies,</hi> Heb. 10.25. Neglect no means ſanctified to work Eſtabliſhment. Theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, you may eaſily perceive what it is to grieve, reſiſt, or quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Grieving and vexing the holy Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.30. Eſay 63.10. doth ſpecially refer to the <hi>perſon of the Spirit,</hi> to the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> the third <hi>perſon</hi> in the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Not as if <hi>he could grieve,</hi> &amp;c. as we do, but it is ſo ſpoken (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to our underſtanding as weak men, that we may know how much it is <hi>againſt him,</hi> when we by our obſtinacy and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our manifold ſins and rebellious, do inforce him to withdraw himſelf and comforts from us, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.12. Reſtore
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:173117:282"/>doth intimate, and to make us feel the fruits of his anger, as a Father doth with grief behold thoſe evils in his Children, for which he muſt needs (though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly) correct them inſtead of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them. Thus the Spirit is grieved by our ſins and Miſdemeanors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reſiſting the holy Spirit</hi> (as it is charged upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially refer to the Motions of the Spirit: which motions and ſuggeſtions, whether ſecretly or openly by the Word of God, his Meſſengers or otherwiſe, are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſiſted and withſtood by wicked and ungodly men: and too often (in ſome things) by the dear Children of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Quenching the Spiit,</hi> doth ſpecially refer to the Gifts of the holy Spirit; which are as Fire to give Light to our Underſtanding, heat and fervour to our Affections.</p>
            <p>☜. <hi>This ſire muſt not be quenched,</hi> but maintained as the Fire of the <hi>Altar,</hi> which was never to go out, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.12, 13. neither by violence put out, nor by Negligence; We muſt not ſtop, reſtrain,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:173117:282"/>or <hi>abate of theſe gifts and motions,</hi> of the Uſe and Degrees, or fervour of any of them, leſt they be loſt, intermitted, or impaired, and our ſelves undone; But we muſt ſtir them up by all good <hi>means</hi> ordained to that end; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Fire, and it will go out of it ſelf, the Fewel muſt be put up together to keep the Fire burning. <hi>Let us take heed that we neither ſtop</hi> the Motions of the Spirit in our ſelves, nor <hi>reſtrain</hi> the gifts thereof in others; But rather let us uſe all good <hi>means,</hi> that this Fire of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>may alwayes be kept burning</hi> in us with Zeal for the honour and glory of God, <hi>till we all appear before,</hi> and ſhine in his preſence, being cloathed with his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and everlaſting Glory. And thus much for the firſt and principal meanes of <hi>growth</hi> and proficiency of encreaſing and abounding in good, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>gaining</hi> and keeping of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Principle of Life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Only thus much more, If any ſhall ask, how the Motions of Gods Spirit, may be diſtinguiſhed from diabolical deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

            <pb n="570" facs="tcp:173117:283"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, 1. By way of <hi>conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> It is true, that <hi>Satanical ſuggeſtions</hi> are oft ſubtilly contrived and cunningly coloured: For <hi>Satan</hi> can transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light, and that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit dares ſometimes to counterfeit the Spirit of Truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</p>
            <p>☞ Scarce ever was <hi>Heretick</hi> ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, but pretended guidance by the Spirit of God. So <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and others, though they deſpiſe Authority, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie all Ordinances, yet pretend to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts and Revelations from the Spirit of God. So did <hi>Montanus</hi> of old for his damned Errours of Whoredom, Inceſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he affirm'd himſelf to be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</p>
            <p>But for diſtinction betwixt theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions: I anſwer, <hi>To the Law and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> Eſay 8.20. let that be your Rule, if they ſpeak not according to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. of lying Wonders: <hi>all must be ſuitable with the Word; Expect not extraordinary Inſpiration,</hi> that is ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God deals not now as formerly, but by his Word, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. which muſt not be added to, or impaired, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> Let <hi>me add a word of Application</hi> uſefull for us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How ſad is the condition of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters from the grace</hi> of God, who having had ſome ſight or taſt of the bleſſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Children of God, as <hi>Balaam</hi> had, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. do either for fear, or love of the World with <hi>Demas,</hi> or the Enjoyment of ſinfull pleaſures, with
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:173117:284"/>thoſe, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 5.6, 11, 13. or the dread of Affliction: Yet they do careleſly <hi>grieve,</hi> &amp; willingly neglect, or do violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt, or wilfully extinguiſh the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed motions and worthy Gifts of Gods Spirit in them, yea and the holy Spirit himſelf; their danger is great, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>their latter end will be worſe then the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Few there be</hi> (at leaſt with us) but hear the good <hi>Voyce</hi> behind them: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is the way, walk in it: but how few regard it?</hi> The uſual end of ſuch men is, <hi>that their hearts grow</hi> more obdurate, <hi>their lives more bruitiſh</hi> &amp; abominable, or <hi>Agonies of conſcience</hi> ariſe which puniſh them with everlaſting deſpair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let <hi>our men that think ſo little</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſerve turn, and that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of a <hi>nimium of devotion,</hi> look to theſe things. <hi>Ds Slater</hi> on 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. Indeed <hi>Papiſts</hi> may well abate of their <hi>Nimium</hi> of Devotions, till they come to that which God hath required of them, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.12. &amp; then upon the point, they muſt, almoſt abate all, either for matter or Manner, upon one reſpect or other, <hi>as they have
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:173117:284"/>strangely changed holy duties,</hi> and divine Services, in holy and ſpiritual worſhip.</p>
            <p>Uſe of Conſolation: Yet <hi>let no weak Chriſtian</hi> take offence at this, as if every ſuppreſſing of a good motion, or <hi>abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirits</hi> fervour, or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſenſible operation in us, ſhould caſt us into an irrecoverable condition; No, <hi>God forbid,</hi> but the ſin is fearful and uncomfortable. Yet, <hi>let the weak Chriſtian</hi> obſerve his firſt declinings, and repair ſpeedily, then all will be well: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks only of a total final loſſe, both of the Exerciſe &amp; Gifts of the holy Ghoſt, which only befals the wicked that are <hi>Reprobates</hi> and <hi>Caſt-awayes.</hi> Thus much be ſpoken of the firſt meanes of promoting this growth, encreaſe, and abounding in good works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The next means is, let Gods Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> the Vine-dreſſers and Keepers of his Orchard and Garden, look well to their Office, <hi>that the Trees under their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,</hi> may be called <hi>trees of Righteouſneſſe, the planting</hi> of the Lord, that he may be glorified, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.3. <hi>the Master will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> of his Husbandmen, how the <hi>fruits</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Now the next means of proſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and increaſe, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> is, <hi>Let all uſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the uſe of Gods Ordinances, and obſerving their opportunities with all ſuch
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:173117:287"/>helps as God hath afforded to this end.</hi> Now for the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scholler that attends diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Maſters or Tutors Readings and Directions, <hi>is like to profit to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. So is the Artificer, or any other Learner in any lawful or uſeful Trade or Myſtery, Art or Science whatſoever. 3. And ſo is the Chriſtian that doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the means of this growth in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with diligence, affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. For this you have a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable example, a preſident ſcarce parrallel'd in the whole Scripture in all particulars. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. <hi>per totum;</hi> For if you confider the particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The Aſſembly, the Generality, and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it, with their deſire and requeſt to</hi> Ezra <hi>the Scribe,</hi> as one man, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2. 2. <hi>Place,</hi> viz. <hi>The open street, under no other roof then the sky,</hi> verſ. 1. 3. <hi>Time,</hi> viz. <hi>Of the Exerciſe from morning till mid-day: They ſpent about about five or ſix hours in thoſe holy duties,</hi> Ver. 2.3. 4. <hi>Attention of the people, the ears of the people were to it,</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>Like them to our

A good warrant for devout Geſtures in the worſhip of God, but not at all for ſuperſtitious geſtures to Frames, and Formes and Fictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed both <hi>Jewiſh</hi> devotion and <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſuperſtition do condemn our want of reverence. 8. Continuance and ſtay of the people there, (<hi>though it was in the open ſtreet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other roof then the sky,</hi> verſ. 1.) till all was done; <hi>For they ſtood in their place, as unwearied till the end</hi> Our people hardly would do ſo; <hi>For we are too ſoon weary of any good works,</hi> verſ. 7.9. The
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:173117:288"/>Prieſts did their work faithfully, <hi>For they did read the Law diſtinctly, expounded it clearly, and applied it faithfully,</hi> which are the three main parts of preaching, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>And the people received the word affectionately,</hi> as appears in their ſorrow, <hi>They wept paſsionately, and grieved mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for their ſins againſt the Law &amp; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God threatned thereupon,</hi> as <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, 2 King. 22.11, 19. <hi>But our hearts are as hard, and dry as the flint,</hi> v. 9. <hi>in their Joy,</hi> which the Prieſts exhorted, and the very day invited them to it, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for a Feſtival, and a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and which they performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, becauſe they underſtood the Law read unto them. Let us do ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12. Charity, for they did ſend portions, and relieved others, as they were exhorted, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Do we do ſo? <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Perſeverance, for the chief of the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went to <hi>Ezra</hi> the next day when the Feaſt was ended, (<hi>For the Feaſts of Trumpets laſted but one day,</hi> Numb. 29.1.) to be further infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſundry points, and that they might the better reſolve the doubts of
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:173117:289"/>others. It were well if we would do ſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Obedience, for they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet up the practiſe of what they had been taught and learned; <hi>And this they did in keeping the feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>ad finem cap.</hi> and this is all that we deſire of our Hearers, <hi>To do,</hi> as <hi>taught.</hi> And thus let us be diligent in making uſe of all good means according to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renowned and unparalle'led example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not like them that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, or below Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſuch as live beſide their food, are like enough to famiſh and periſh.</p>
            <p>To the uſe of means, be ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your opportunities of Grace, as Merchants, Mariners, Tradeſmen, Husbandmen, Sheepherds, Fiſhermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All do in their ſeveral affairs and occaſions in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So do you in this heavenly affair, as God doth offer you more means, and afford you many precious opportunities which others have not: Be sure you improve the ſame to your further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and abounding in good fruits.</p>
            <p>Thus much be ſpoken of this third
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:173117:289"/>help to proficiency, <hi>viz. To make good uſe of Gods Ordinances, and our own op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next means or help of growth and ſtrength to abound, is <hi>Exerciſe;</hi> This muſt be thus, <hi>viz. As proficiency comes on, be ſure to make uſe of your graces and abilities;</hi> As the Scholler that hath learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Grammer Rules, and is well verſ'd in them, will try how he can make Latine ſuitable to the ſame: And the <hi>Logician</hi> that hath well learned his Logick Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be diſputing, and try how he can frame an Argument, as well knowing the Rule, <hi>Fruſtra fit potentia, quae non reducitur in actum,</hi> Ability not acted, is little worth. So the young Scribe, <hi>Scribendo diſcit ſcribere;</hi> the more he writes; the better and more eaſily he may write. Yea Labourers and Travellers are better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Buſineſs and Journeys, by uſe and exerciſe.</p>
            <p>And to encourage us hereto, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath given a gracious promiſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Omni habenti, (&amp; utenti) dabitur,</hi> Mat. 25.29. And

               </gap>, <hi>Negotiamini,</hi> Occupy, imploy or make uſe of theſe Talents till I come. To this end the Apoſtle bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Reſuſcitare,</hi> To ſtir up, to renew, and ſet in former ſtrength the gift of God which was in him: So ſhould we; That we may counſel and comfort others, <hi>as we our ſelves have been of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. as the Apoſtle did in time of his Troubles: And the more we do in this kind to others, the more ability we have to do ſo ſtill: <hi>He that faithfully uſeth the graces of God, ſhall have them increaſed;</hi> whereas in other things, <hi>The more we ſpend, the leſs we have, till all be gone.</hi> Money, and Goods, and Lands, and great Eſtates may ſoon be ſpent by uſe or gift, liberality or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, bounty or magnificence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here it is otherwiſe: The more free and liberral any man is of his Graces in a right uſe of them, <hi>The more his ſtock increaſes, and the richer he is in a ſpiritual endowment, the more he gives, the more he
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:173117:290"/>gains; till he be filled, brim-full, with the fulneſs of God in everlasting glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the fourth help to proficiency, <hi>viz.</hi> Exerciſeſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The laſt help to proficiency, is <hi>guod ſociety; make uſe of it;</hi> for a man either is, or is like to be ſuch an one as his Companions are. A man is much bettered or worſed by company: <hi>For the words of the wiſe are as nails and goads,</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>And do miniſter grace to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Epheſians. c. 4.29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E Contra,</hi> the language of evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <hi>is like an open Sepulchre, and the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps, full of filthineſs and deadly poyſon,</hi> ſo is the diſcourſe of ſuch, full of blaſphemies againſt God, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and railing at men (not of their mind) and as contagiouſly infectious, as the poyſon of Alps; <hi>For which there is no remedy but cutting of,</hi> Rom. 3.13.

            <p>From this laſt particular in this verſe: you have heard the main end of all our preaching and your learning, <hi>viz. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in grace, and abounding in good works, is a Christians excellency as well as it is his duty.</hi> This point hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed to you at large: The Uſes were of <hi>Lamentation, Reproof, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; Examination,</hi> and <hi>Conſolation.</hi>
               <pb n="589" facs="tcp:173117:291"/>The three firſt of theſe are diſpatcht al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; The two laſt remains, ſo that I am now upon the fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 4. The fourth Uſe is of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which puts us upon the Trial, whether we do increaſe and abound as we ought to do, and for the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this tryal, and our more certainty therein, foraſmuch as we are fallen upon the Scripture-allegory, which doth often compare the faithful to the <hi>Trees of the garden of God,</hi> as the <hi>Vires, Palms</hi> and <hi>Cedars.</hi> &amp;c. let me give you a taſt of your tryal from ſome ſigns which do appear in Trees, whether they do thrive and proſper, or not; which ſigns do ariſe from the <hi>Root, Body, Bark, Branch, Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Stature</hi> of ſuch Trees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Root.</hi> The Tree firmly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grows amain and proſpers. Oh that this were our caſe; this is that which the Apoſtle prays for heartily, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades to ſeriouſly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. to 20. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>viz. That they may be ſtrengthned, well rooted, and firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith, able to comprehend,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:173117:292"/>So were moſt of the Martyrs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Jeſus in all ages; theſe could ſtand in a ſtorm, and abide terrible blaſts: Neither Perſecuters, nor Seducers could pluck them up by the roots: Such were ſome of the Churches of <hi>Aſia, viz. Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 2.8, 18. &amp; 3.7. yet had they Perſecutors, Seducers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To try what they could do: This is the driſt of the Miniſtry, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13, to 17. <hi>That we may become perfect men, no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth, might grow up in Chriſt in all things.</hi> Now that you may be ſure that you are well rooted, <hi>look what faith you have, for Faith is a root,</hi> which in a well grown Chriſtian is very ſtrong; it ſendeth forth its ſuckers to the Rivers, <hi>The waters of life which bring in ſupply, and do enable us to,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Great obedience,</hi> as in <hi>Abraham of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up</hi> Iſaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. The rich in Faith, are ſo in good works: This Root yields abundance of good fruit: <hi>The poor of this world that are rich in faith, are choſen of God, and Heirs of the kingdom promiſed by him,</hi> Jam. 2.5. <hi>The rich in this
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:173117:292"/>world that have learned not to be high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And to do good, to be rich in good works: Theſe lay a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19. Poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> both being rich in Faith, do enjoy the ſame Glory with God, this is a good root, that ſends up its branches and fruit as high as heaven; this faith doth perform.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Great Conqueſts over ſin,</hi> and great corruptions. <hi>The Faith of Miracles</hi> could remove Mountains, ſo can this. <hi>For by faith we do reſiſt the Devil,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. <hi>And put him to flight,</hi> Jam. 4.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To ſtand againſt great diſcouragement</hi> as Job 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him;</hi> and that woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi> 15.22, to 29. Who by faith ſtill waited upon Chriſt, againſt the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his not being ſent to ſuch, and terming her a Dog.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>And in great dangers:</hi> A good man ſhall not be moved for ever nor be afraid of evil tidings, <hi>His heart is fixed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112.6, 7. And our Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:173117:293"/>viſeth us. <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled:</hi> Why? Mark their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God, <hi>believe alſo in me,</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manſions are prepared for you, <hi>and you ſhall be with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Faith is a bleſſed root; the Tree ſo rooted ſhall proſper: And concerning this, we all had need to pray with him in the Go pel. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>And that with tears,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief:</hi> thus Faith is the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> root, producing Obedience, Courage, Patience and Peſerverance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Body:</hi> Look upon the body of a Tree, and Judge of its proficiency, ſo upon the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> In a tree that is now become Timber, fit to be a Pillar, a principle beam in the building, which was but a Twig <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Corn,</hi> When ſown, and a while after we ſee little, or nothing; but when it is grown, it is viſible and ſenſible to all, though we ſaw not how it grew, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.26. to 30. So it is here. The Saints that lately were but Babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. are now become ſtrong men that can wreſtle with God,
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:173117:293"/>as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and prevailed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how was this wreſtling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He wept and made ſupplication unto him; he found him in <hi>Bethel,</hi> i.e. the Houſe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 12.4, 4, 5. So <hi>David</hi> alſo, in the temptation about the proſperity of the wicked muſt to <hi>Bethel,</hi> the Sanctuary of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.17. There he prevailed and underſtood their end, how ſoon they came to deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sathan</hi> alſo, and all his powers: <hi>for we wreſtle not against fleſh and blood, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt principalities, againſt powers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Afſtictions</hi> alſo, which the godly bear, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the gates of <hi>Agazah,</hi> Jud. 16.3. <hi>which would break the back of a child.</hi> Thus by the <hi>Body,</hi> you may diſcern the growth of this Tree of Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Bark, which of a thriveable</hi> Tree is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſmooth, and not moſſy &amp; rugged, as of ſome other trees which proſper not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So here, look upon the <hi>Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the <hi>countenance</hi> and carriage; the external profeſſion, practiſe and dealing of the godly, is ſuch, that their profiting doth appear to all, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are not Rugged,</hi> and overgrown
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:173117:294"/>with evil practiſes like others, whoſe lives are ſpent in laſciviouſneſs, luſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, revellings, banquettings, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatries; running into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Riot, and ſpeaking evil of the godly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4. as the Drunkards did of <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 69.11, 12. Whereas the godly like <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Companions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. have <hi>a new complexion of Soul, a ſmoothneſſe,</hi> not of hypocriſie, but of ſincerity. <hi>New Tongues,</hi> Mark 16.17. ſuch as they were not uſed to: For before they <hi>were earthly,</hi> Joh. 3.31. <hi>he that is of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>worldly,</hi> 1 John 4.5. For <hi>they of the world, ſpeak of the world,</hi> &amp;c. But now it is otherwiſe with them, they have learned a new Language, <hi>for the mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. And why? but becauſe the <hi>law of his God is in his heart,</hi> Pſ. 37.30, 31. A <hi>good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> yields a ſuitable ſtream, ſo ſuch an heart; and the <hi>good woman openeth her mouth</hi> with wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pro. 31.26. and the Law of kindneſſe (not of ſcolding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is <hi>in her Tongue.</hi> Corrupt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is changed into that which is <hi>good</hi> for the uſe of edifying, that it <hi>may
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:173117:294"/>miniſter grace to the Hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. They have put away, and (as it were) purged out all thoſe evil Qualities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.8. <hi>anger, wrath, malice, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, filthy-communications, lying,</hi> and the like; and <hi>have put on</hi> (as the Elect of God) Bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and Forgiving one another in the caſe of Quarrel, and above all, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing charity, which is the bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Col. 3.12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Branch;</hi> The flouriſhing branches of fruitfull Trees, are a ſhelter and refreſhing to many. So <hi>is the proſperity of the godly,</hi> whether it be external, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if they flouriſh &amp; proſper outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the World, as well as inwardly &amp; ſpiritually in the things of God; and if God bleſs them with abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, then they become a ſhelter to others: as <hi>Job</hi> 29.12. to 18. to <hi>the poor, blind and lame,</hi> and men ready to periſh: And as the Lord himſelf, ſo they alſo in their proportion, do become <hi>strength</hi> to the poor and needy, a <hi>Refuge</hi> from the ſtorm, a <hi>ſhadow</hi> from the heat, when the
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:173117:295"/>blaſt of the terrible Ones, is as a ſtorm againſt the Wall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.4. to ſhelter it; but that God reſtrains Wrath, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 76.10. or, as good <hi>O badiah</hi> to the 100.

            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> Thus <hi>theſe flouriſhing Trees,</hi> if they do abound in <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual graces,</hi> viz. in Faith, Utterance, and in Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c. as well as in outward things,</hi> like <hi>Gajus,</hi> 3 John. 2. then you may be ſure, they will abound in this Grace alſo, <hi>i.e.</hi> in Charity and the Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Bounty, Liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fruit: Every man will judge</hi> of the goodneſs of a Tree by its Fruit: <hi>if the fruit be good,</hi> the tree is ſo alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So theſe trees in the Garden of God (whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God</hi>) they <hi>have their fruit unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and the end everlasting life,</hi> Rom. 6.2, 2. their words and works are holy: they bring forth good fruit, and ſhall (be ſure) not to loſe their reward: <hi>no labour is loſt in this kind,</hi> but ſhall be richly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced.

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Stature;</hi> We judge Trees and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things by their ſtature, <hi>all trees and men,</hi> &amp;c. are not of the ſame dimenſions of ſtature, yet they may have a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable perfection ſuitable to that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they are capable of: and that ſtature is Argument enough of their growth, ſtrength and proficiency: and <hi>a little man,</hi> a <hi>ſlender Tree,</hi> may be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and fruitfull, yet <hi>every tree and man muſt</hi> attain to that fulneſs and perfection of ſtature allotted him by Nature, and
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:173117:296"/>then they are of full growth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So it is with true Chriſtians (the Trees of the Garden of God) all have not the ſame meaſure of <hi>grace,</hi> ſome have more, ſome leſſe: as of <hi>faith, hope, patience</hi> and other <hi>perfections,</hi> yet all muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a full growth, <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13. Now <hi>this fulneſſe</hi> of ſtature, this high meaſure of growth doth refer to 1. <hi>particular perſons as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> or 2. the whole Church, as the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>particular perſons</hi> the members of the Church; you muſt know that all are not of the ſame ſtature, growth and perfection in godlineſſe, ſome are of one, and others of another dimenſion. Some are Babes in Chriſt, weak Chriſtians that muſt be fed with milk. Others are ſtrong and tall in perfections, who feed upon ſtrong meat, having their ſenſes exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcern both good and evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.13, 14. Yet nevertheleſs this Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all have their growth and meaſure of <hi>grace</hi> proportioned for them: though this meaſure, or ſtature of a Chriſtian in
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:173117:297"/>
               <hi>grace,</hi> cannot be ſtated in this life, becauſe here we can never attain to perfection; the <hi>babe</hi> hath his fulneſs, and the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> his wants: other things attain to their <hi>Achme</hi> of Nature, the top of perfection. the <hi>Chriſtians top-ſtone</hi> is in Heaven, <hi>Ergo,</hi> whileſt we be here, let us be ſtill grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and learning to abound more and more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As this</hi> ſtature doth refer to the <hi>whole Body of the Church,</hi> together: Note, That in Heaven every member ſhall be filled with perfection of grace and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the knowledge of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: and then the <hi>whole myſtical body of Chriſt ſhall be compleated</hi> in Glory, by the addition of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in perfection. To which end the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is ſingularly uſeful to the end of the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 11, to 17. You do <hi>know</hi> the point under-hand, the <hi>confirmation</hi> &amp; <hi>application</hi> of it, the Uſes are five: all which are diſmiſt but the laſt, which I do now enter upon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Uſe <hi>is of Conſolation;</hi> the comfort cannot but be very great, <hi>to all that find this growth</hi> and ſtrength, this proficiency,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:173117:297"/>and ability in themſelves: the meaſure of this ſtature in ſo large a proportion: Each proof and Argument, Inſtance and Illuſtration of the point, cannot but fill them with abundant conſolation, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. The very ſenſe and conſcience of <hi>well-doing</hi> is full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; The experience of a <hi>well-grown</hi> Chriſtian, of his own danger and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, Conflicts &amp; Conqueſts, beſides the manifold promiſes of God to them that overcome, that <hi>fight the good fight</hi> of Faith, and <hi>run the Race</hi> ſet before them, that <hi>hold out</hi> to the end, and are <hi>faithfull</hi> to the Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. Theſe are <hi>ſtreams of comfort,</hi> that refreſh the ſouls of ſuch with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual comforts that will never be dryed up; ſo that to ſuch, light looks in at every creviſe, and joy at every loop-hole. <hi>A window is opened</hi> into the Ark of their Breaſts, to aſſure them that the waters of Tribulations, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> are aſſwaged, and <hi>a wide door is opened</hi> to them into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. Therefore I need not ſpeak much to comfort them, that are thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:173117:298"/>comforted of God, and <hi>endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch fulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2, But this Uſe of comfort is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended <hi>to all ſuch as write bitter things</hi> againſt themſelves, and deny their own mercies: nevertheleſs, that they haue much intereſt in the Comforts of God. They are full of fears and doubts, and are apt to object againſt themſelves in this (or the like) manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>this fulneſs,</hi> meaſure and ſtature of perfection; <hi>I fall ſo far ſhort of it,</hi> becauſe of my corruptions and evils remaining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I do even deſpair of ever attaining to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And <hi>as for growth, I fear Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes</hi> and <hi>Ebbs in me,</hi> becauſe I am not ſo affected, and earneſt in the purſuit of it, and love of it, as I have formerly been at my firſt converſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides, <hi>I do want that ſenſe, ſight and feeling</hi> of Gods Favour and Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he uſually beſtoweth upon good Proficients: as alſo of my own full aſſurance of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, <hi>I am expoſed to</hi> Satans <hi>Siftings, Buffettings</hi> and Temptations, as it befell

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer 1. <hi>By way of conceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that all this may be: For God is pleaſed ſometimes to withdraw his own preſence and to withhold our aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſpecial ends, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To make us ſee our own weakneſs, in doing good, or bearing evil: how that without him we move as <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots did without Wheels: and when ſtorms and troubles ariſe and appear as imminent, we ſink, or deny as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30. and 26.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſeek, ſupport, and ſtrength of him, as Infants do to be upheld by the Parent or Nurſe, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.12. and of which he was very confident, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 27.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo freely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear them not, for I am with thee, be not diſpaid, for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee: yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="604" facs="tcp:173117:299"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be more watchfull against occaſions,</hi> &amp; Temptations to ſin, <hi>ictus piſcator ſapit,</hi> ſayes the old Proverb; the Fiſherman that hath touch'd a <hi>Torpedo</hi> (or Cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh) will be more wary afterwards, and the <hi>burnt-child</hi> will fear the <hi>fire,</hi> ſay we, and he that hath hurt himſelf by a Fall, will look to his Feet hereafter. This is caſe: and the end of Gods withdrawing his Comforts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For <hi>Correction,</hi> as to <hi>David, pſalm</hi> 51.8, 12 whoſe <hi>bones</hi> were ſo broken, &amp; <hi>joyes</hi> ſo eclipſed (you know for what) that he prayed heartily to God, to ſplint, and to reſtore his joyes again.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For <hi>tryal of their Faith &amp; patience,</hi> &amp;c. as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Job, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. Tribulation produceth patience, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Hope.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="7">7. <hi>To work in us Commiſeration,</hi> and pitty towards others that are fallen, <hi>Not to inſult over,</hi> but <hi>to help and restore ſuch perſons,</hi> Gal. 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>if a man be overtaken in a fault,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2. To the ſecond, as <hi>to their fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in Grace,</hi> and want of love to it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that in Grace there is <hi>the newneſſe of</hi> it at firſt, and <hi>the worth of it alwayes.</hi> Now in our firſt converſion, we are moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Excellency of Grace, though we may prize it at as high a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, and worth ever after: As <hi>we are with Land and Jewels,</hi> we are moſt taken with them at the firſt: yet we valew them at as high a rate many years after. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> diſtinguiſh of Love <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè,</hi> or <hi>Appretiativè</hi> Let <hi>your love to Grace ſet a valew</hi> upon it, though the <hi>ardour</hi> of your Affections do not alwayes flame alike towards it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the third, touching the <hi>ſenſe of Gods Favour,</hi> &amp;c and the aſſurance of our own ſalvation. You muſt conſider, That
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:173117:301"/>
               <hi>no man is alwayes alike,</hi> either in Bodily health, or ſpiritual Comforts: we muſt <hi>expect viciſsitudes</hi> and bear them. And <hi>as to our aſſurance;</hi> Be ſure to ſecure the <hi>Certitudo Adhaerentiae,</hi> though the <hi>Certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Evidentiae</hi> be abſent. The <hi>Aſſurance of evidence</hi> is haveable by ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but all true Chriſtians have the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Adherence. They are ſure, they do cleave only to Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for their ſalvation, and upon no other, Saint or Angel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to him they live, and apply themſelves in their Converſation. This <hi>Aſsurance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured, the other will follow in Life or Death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To the fourth, touching <hi>Satans Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fettings, Temptations,</hi> &amp;c. Neither look to be fully freed from them in this world: the beſt have born them, <hi>but Glory is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that will free us from them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 20. Thus much in Anſwer by way of Mitigation.</p>
            <p>Now thirdly, I anſwer in the way of Conſolation to weak Chriſtians: That nevertheleſs the fore-named Scruples, Doubts and Fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:173117:301"/>their great Affliction, yet their comfort is, and may be, that <hi>they ſhall not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way totally and finally from Grace,</hi> and that upon theſe Grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> 2. <hi>Vocation.</hi> 3. <hi>Gods covenant and Promiſes.</hi> 4. <hi>Chriſts All-ſufficiency;</hi> and 5. <hi>the Seal of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Election of God,</hi> is firm and ſure: <hi>an Act of</hi> Gods free Grace; Hence <hi>all things work together for their good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. to 35. For the gifts and Calling of God are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Vocation,</hi> Our Calling is unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10, By which God infuſeth into the Elect a <hi>principle</hi> of Duration and continuance: and hereupon it is called <hi>Radix inſita,</hi> a Root deeply faſtened or ſetled in us; Such have Root in themſelves which the ſeed in the ſtony ground wanted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. &amp; therefore dured or continued but a while, <hi>Sermo inſitus,</hi> An ingraffed Word, which as <hi>a graff</hi> turns the ſtock into its owne Nature: a <hi>Metaphor from graffing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 1.21. Or an <hi>implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:173117:302"/>Word,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which will grow up, encreaſe and continue long with you, <hi>Semen manens, &amp; Immortale,</hi> a ſeed <hi>remaining in us,</hi> 1 John 3.9. and we are ſaid to <hi>be born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible,</hi> by <hi>the Word of God,</hi> which liveth and abideth for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. For, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.89. We may all ſay, For ever, O Lord, thy <hi>Word</hi> is ſetled in Heaven: as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio manens,</hi> An Anointing which abideth in men, and teacheth them all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.27. the Word &amp; Spirit of God, will ſafeguard you from falſe Teachers. The Spirit that Anointed Chriſt for a King and Prieſt, hath alſo anointed you to be ſuch <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> Revel. 1.6. that you may be able to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe Teachers; and <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>from a Spring</hi> or <hi>Fountain,</hi> the Graces of Gods Spirit are communicated to us, <hi>John</hi> 1, 16, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ This is no new Light, to make men contemn their faithfull Godly Teachers <hi>(Sed contra) but a true Light,</hi> to teach us to honour them, and obey
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:173117:302"/>their godly Doctrine. <hi>Spiritus inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> the Spirit of God dwelling in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. &amp; 6.19. A moſt deſireable gueſt, which infuſeth and ſupporteth grace in us, and will not ſuddenly change his habitation: Let it be our care not to grieve him, quench or reſiſt his graces or motions, <hi>&amp;c. but to pleaſe him in all things. Fons aquaeſalientis in vitam aeternam,</hi> Joh. 4.14. <hi>A well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life,</hi> i.e. <hi>The grace and ſpirit of regeneration,</hi> with the bleſſed fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with which their weary ſouls ſhall be ſo refreſhed, and they themſelves ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and furniſhed with all good, <hi>That they ſhall be ſatisfied as in the preſence of God,</hi> Iſa. 49.9. So that as the gift of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo alſo of our vocation which is of God, is without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>For whom he called, them he alſo juſtified and glorified,</hi> 8.30.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A third Argument of Comfort againſt all the Scruples aforeſaid. Gods Covenant and Promiſes which are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable, irrefragable (or invincible) and unchangeable, as the water of <hi>Noah, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa 54.6, 7, to 11. <hi>Nay, the mountains
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:173117:303"/>may be removed,</hi> &amp;c. But the kindneſs of God, and the Covenant of his peace, ſhall never be removed from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but he will have mercy upon them, So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, to 38. God doth covenant with his people, to write his law in their hearts, and to fill them with knowledge. and to ſhew how unchangable he is in his Covenant and Promiſes; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them with the ordinances of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: So that as ſure as the courſe, which God hath eſtabliſhed in nature for the conſtant motion and intercourſe of the celeſtial Creatures, the Sun, Moon and Stars, to give light by day, and by night, and for confining that vaſt body of the Sea to the place, and limits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to it; as ſure, I ſay, as theſe things ſhall without interruption or intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſiſt in their courſe unto the end of the world: ſo ſure is his Covenant with his people; nor ſhall it be changed, till the heavens above can be exactly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, or the foundation of the earth ſearched out by us men, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be. So unchangable is his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his people: As for thoſe
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:173117:303"/>words in the Covenant, They ſhall no more teach every man his Neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not to be conceived, as if they ſhould have no need of teaching at all in thoſe times, or that the Office of Teachers ſhould then ceaſe as ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For while men live in this world, they know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. &amp; 13.19. Nor can any be ſo perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or grace whilſt they live here, but that they may grow further, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. I have not yet attained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. And the Office of teaching is to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by the different conceits, and interpretations of many; This form of ſpeech may very well intimate the great meaſure of clear light that ſhould in thoſe times be revealed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 6. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid.</hi> &amp;c. For God who commanded the light to ſhine out dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. The great meaſure of knowledge that ſhould by reaſon thereof abound. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. <hi>As
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:173117:304"/>the waters cover the ſea.</hi> So Hab. 2.14. <hi>The clearneſs of underſtanding that many ſhould be ſo poſſeſſed with,</hi> as if taught by irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, rather than by any means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Cal.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I received not the Goſpel of man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The numeroſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons then above former times, yea, and amongſt the meaner ſort of people, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.25, 26. And thus much by the way, for Explanation of that phraſe in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now as the Covenant of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable to his people, ſo for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in cleaving to him, (wherein li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the doubt) we have a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. That as God will not turn away from us to do us good, ſo he will put his fear into our hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him, whence conclude, that when a people are really brought home to Chriſt, they ſhall never fall off from him again. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21. <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come to Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and unto them that turn from tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>My ſpirit is upon thee, and the words that I have put
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:173117:304"/>in thy mouth, ſhall not depart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Chriſts fulneſs,</hi> and Al-ſufficiency, his Potency and Prevalency: 1. In ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>For by him alone we have received the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5.11. He only hath wrought reconciliation betwixt God and us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. He is our High Prieſt, who once for all, hath offered up one ſacrifice for ſins for ever; by which one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctifi'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 10, 11, 12, 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In ſupplication for all Believers, and his prayers are prevalent, and were never denyed; See <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>per totum,</hi> and Verſ. 20. to 25.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Seal and earneſt of the holy Spirit in our hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth in us his Vocation and Election by the grace of regeneration, which is a Seal-ſigning, or marking us for himſelf: as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure; having this Seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his; and let him that nameth the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt depart from iniquity. This is the Lords ſeal: and his Earneſt
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:173117:305"/>is much to the ſame effect; for as an Earneſt is a pledge whereby we confirm a bargain, or a piece of money, whereby we aſſure the payment of the whole ſum remaining.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ap.</hi> So the Seal and Eearneſt of our Regeneration, and the renewing of Gods image within us, is the pledge of our whole Inheritance, and doth aſſure us more and more of the accompliſhment of all Gods gracious promiſes towards us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. And as a deed after ſealing is unchangable, and a Bargain after Earneſt given, is irreverſible: So is the Sealing and Earneſt of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> which altered not, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.8.) unalterable; For true Believers are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time at Chriſts appearance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. when we ſhall be made partakers of that inheritance incorruptible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>For when Chriſt, who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.4.</p>
            <pb n="617" facs="tcp:173117:305"/>
            <p>Thus the comfort of a true (though weak) Chriſtian, doth ſpring from our Election, which is of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. Our Vocation, which is heavenly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. Gods Covenant and Promiſes which are unchangable. Chriſts ſulneſs and Al-ſufficiency in ſatisfaction and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Seal and Earneſt of the holy Spirit in our hearts: ſo that though it may ſo befal, that as ſometimes we our ſelves do not ſee our own ſafety; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may, when we cannot not; and though Grace be but ſmall, and of ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der growth in us, yet if it be true, it will receive a bleſſing from God, and make way to eternal Glory. The hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of our comfort ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; ſuch as <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Darkneſs; and the power of Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whom we are called. Furtherance to duty is afforded, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. For the Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:173117:306"/>at his coming, ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glorious body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Phil. 3.20, 21. And thus doth he induct his ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heavenly glory: God will own and crown all his own works and graces in us, to our everlaſting felicity: <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done further ſpeaking of the Apoſtles farewell, but I truſt you will never have done practiſing what this Scripture hath ſuggeſted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hath been taught unto you, which will be of ſingular uſe to preſerve you from Atheiſm, Papiſm and Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and to direct you in the way that is truly Chriſtian, where you may walk and pleaſe God, and abound in good, till you may attain to glory, which the good Lord grant unto us.</p>
